Help on: *wrap

This command allows you to wrap the lines of a room description
so as to even it out. It gets rid of the pesky indent that comes
with a description which is accidentally made too long. It can be
done on both long and short descriptions.

Syntax:
*wrap <s | l> <length>, where length is from 60-77.
