RoH Standard Building Conventions

1) Exits always have the same order:
   n, e, s, w, ne, nw, se, sw, up, down (other exits)
   Even if some of these are missing, use this order.
   *xarrange will order the exits for you.
2) Names of rooms are always capitalized.
3) Only NAMED perms have capital letters in their names.
4) All doors/gates must have openable and closeable 
   flags set (4 and 6)
5) Average mob traffic is 20%...35% max unless you ask a DM and
   have a reason for higher. For areas of high spawn, please
   set a maximum amount of monsters allowed in the room 
   at a time.
6) Perms in an area should never be set to come back around 
   the same time. Make every perm in a particular area have 
   a different timeout value.
7) Never blend the short and long description of a room.
8) Never place profane or sexually explicit words in a room
   description.
9) Do not put 2 spaces after periods or commas. This is a mud,
   not a formal paper.
10) Do not use superfluous capitalization in descriptions.

If more is ever added to this, you will all be notified.
