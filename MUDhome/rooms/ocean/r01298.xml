  <ShortDescription>You are between the Ashton creek and the west side of a great stump.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path continues in a circle, staying close to the great stump.  The
gnarly roots twist and turn in every direction, making it difficult to
to climb over them in places.  Not far to the west is the creek, and a
little further to the north you can see a rope bridge going from east
to west across it.</LongDescription>
