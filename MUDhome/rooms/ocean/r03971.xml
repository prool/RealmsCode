  <ShortDescription>You are in the private living quarters of Llanandar, the elven bowyer.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Llanandar likes his privacy, but not particularly your presense here.
The room is even smaller than the shop downstairs, and you have to bow your
head to keep from hitting it on the ceiling.  A tiny bed is shoved against
the wall, and a private collection of bows are on the wall above it.</LongDescription>
