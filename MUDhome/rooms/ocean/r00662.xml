  <ShortDescription>You are on Center Drive, between the Ziggurat and the Sleepy Traveller Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Sleepy Traveller Inn is popular among the people who are staying in
Oceancrest for long lengths of time.  The accomodations are not quite as
nice as the Evenborough Inn or some of the other inns in town, but the
prices are right for a week or month long stay in Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
