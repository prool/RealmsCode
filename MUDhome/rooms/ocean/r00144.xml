  <ShortDescription>You are on Taragon Road, opposite a dark pub called the Deft Hand.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side is a vine-covered wall which surrounds the village, and
on the west side is a dim little pub known as the Deft Hand.  It's not
a real popular place because more people go in there than come out.  The
village militia seem to have a hands-off policy concerning the Deft Hand,
as they never go in, except to collect a handful of gold and then leave.</LongDescription>
