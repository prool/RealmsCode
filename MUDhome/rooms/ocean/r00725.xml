  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, south of Roger's Taxidermy.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>After a good hunting trip, many hunters prefer to have their catch 
stuffed as a trophy to display proudly and tell friends how they single
handedly cut down this towering grizzly bear.  On the south side of the
road, you can hear the faint cheers from the spectators at the Ivanhouse
Sporting Facility.</LongDescription>
