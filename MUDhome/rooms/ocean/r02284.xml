  <ShortDescription>You are in the Uland Repair Shop in the southeastern corner of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large man stands behind the counter and asks if he can be of some service
to you.  The Uland Repair Shops fixes just about any broken weapon, armor
or even enchanted items.  Unfortunately, one cannot guarentee not having
an accident, so the smith might end up breaking something now and then.</LongDescription>
