  <ShortDescription>You are in the western hall of the Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the hall of nobility, which leads to the private quarters of long 
dead royalty.  The scorched hallway is a sad reminder of glorious days of
past ages.  After the Witch made this her home, she brought in pigs to keep
in the royal bedchambers, as an insult to the family.  Now, there are pig 
skeletons littering the floor.</LongDescription>
