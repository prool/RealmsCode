  <ShortDescription>You are in the exhibit with a large pool of swimming piranha in the center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large pool in the center contains many vicious piranha swimming around
in packs of up to twenty.  It is not really advised that you even touch the
water around the pool because piranha can smell blood miles away.  It is
said that a swarm of piranha can debone a living horse in less than a couple
of minutes.</LongDescription>
