  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A long and narrow public park runs along side the eastern city wall, ending
at the library on the north side of the road.  Over on the west side you
see there is a private school that teaches hand-to-hand combat.  Not a bad
thing to know in these dangerous times.</LongDescription>
