  <ShortDescription>You are in an old corridor that doesn't appear to be used much anymore.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small cavern is too small for any frost giants to move around in and
the cumulation of dust and cobwebs suggests that the passage hasn't been
used much at all in the past few years.  The cavern continues to the
north and south.</LongDescription>
