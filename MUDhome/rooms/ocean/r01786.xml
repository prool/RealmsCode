  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, just west of the Allakaren Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mysterious Allakaren Circle and the even more mysterious Tree of Life
lies to the east along Monument Avenue.  On the north side of the road,
you can see the Dragon Claw Tavern and Grill, where a number of citizens
go to enjoy a good steak, and to talk about the disasterous day they've
had.  The entrance to the tavern is arond the corner to the west, on
Melbourne Avenue.  Directly south is a shabby little shop known as the
welfare office.</LongDescription>
