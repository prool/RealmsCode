  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, south of a small shopping complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the center of this city block between Rosecrest Street and
Oceanview Drive.  On the north, you can see three buildings in a small
shopping complex.  Directly to the north is the Silver Tears Gambling
Hall.  Security appears to be pretty lax around the small building,
so it's unlikely that there's any serious gambling going on.  It seems
to be a small-time operation for amusement during lunch or dinner.</LongDescription>
