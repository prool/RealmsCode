  <ShortDescription>You are at the Quick Car terminal for the City of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The quick cars were developed by the elves to let them move around
the mountains quickly and safely without having to deal with all the
threats on the surface.  With the help of dwarven miners and elven
ingenuity, the quick cars zip through the tunnels at speeds close
to 60 kilometers per hour.  Hold on tight.</LongDescription>
