  <ShortDescription>You are crawling through a secret passage in the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the broken stones which were once part of the walls and floor make it
difficult to traverse the passageway, and in places you must crawl where
you would rather walk.  From time-to-time, you hear the sound of falling
stones or timbers somewhere in the distance.</LongDescription>
