  <ShortDescription>You are on a park path near the northwestern end of Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path is steep at this particular point, and looking down you can see
the Lithium Inlet as it empties into the north end of Nylandian Bay.  
Perhaps five meters above you is the top of the path which disappears
over the rim of the cliff there.  There is an extremely bright light
coming from just over the top of the cliff.</LongDescription>
