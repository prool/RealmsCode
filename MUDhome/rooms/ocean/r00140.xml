  <ShortDescription>You are on the east bank of the Baldywyne River, walking on East Ulandia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's a lot of cheering and noise coming from the building to the east.
A large poster indicates the building houses a cock fighting arena.  The
poster says that there is no-limit betting allowed, and your bet of any
size will be covered.  There's a picture of two fighting cocks staring at
each other, and the print underneath says they are both undefeated.</LongDescription>
