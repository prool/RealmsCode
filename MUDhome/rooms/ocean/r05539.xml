  <Name>Nyyron Water Chamber</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very damp chamber behind the curtain of the Nyyron Waterfall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The slabs of stone in here are warm to the touch, and steam from the water
fills the room, making your sore muscles relax.  The chamber looks clean and
comfortable, and is certainly well hidden.  This might be a good place to
rest awhile.  There are some runes on the wall, which indicates this place
may have been used for magic spells at one time.</LongDescription>
