  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Orchard Lane, south of the Swallow's Nest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Swallow's Nest is a rather large bar exclusively for officers of
the city guard.  Although they do allow members of the other guard
affiliations, they do not much care for outsiders, and will do whatever
they can to get rid of people who do not belong there.</LongDescription>
