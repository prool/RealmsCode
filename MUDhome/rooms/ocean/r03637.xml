  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the main courtyard near the Chapel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A wide oak door is closed in the east wall of the castle, but a cross
burned in the center of it identifies it as the entrance to the Chapel.
A rain barrel stands by the door, full of fresh water.  The great court-
yard to the west is often used to assemble the fighting forces of Prince
Ragnar, and the monks in the chapel use the water to bless each warrior
before he goes to battle.</LongDescription>
