  <ShortDescription>You are in the back alley of a large shopping complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The alley is very dark and really smells bad.  As you walk along, you 
stumble over drunks and knock down their make-shift houses of discarded
tree bark.  You're not sure anything could survive down here, but then
again,you're not sure you'd want to meet anything that could.</LongDescription>
