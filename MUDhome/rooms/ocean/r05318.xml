  <ShortDescription>The Lyanden Road follows the northern boundary of the immense K'tral Desert.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The desert actually forms a buffer with the badlands farther south.
Entire caravans have beeen lost in the K'tral, but it is a faster route
between Brownhaven and Oceancrest.  However, no one has ever been known
to enter the badlands and return, except a few raving lunatics.</LongDescription>
