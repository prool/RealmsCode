  <ShortDescription>You are in the Unblemished Armor shop in Leonardo's Foundry.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Armors are Leonardo's specialty, specifically chain and brigandine.  Chain
Mail is made of interlocking metalic rings which provide excellent
protection against enemy swords.  Brigandine mail is similar to chain, 
but made with light plates of metal rivited in between cloth and leather.
It provides less protection, but is an inexpensive alternative to chain.</LongDescription>
