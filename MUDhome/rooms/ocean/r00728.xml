  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Highland Avenue, east of the Dragon's Citadel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dragon's Citadel is a rather unedifying place of massive proportions.
The off green color has faded over long years through wars and natural
disasters.  But the facility still stands proudly.  Too bad no one has
ever been able to get into the Citadel, even though it's thought to have
been abandoned centuries ago.</LongDescription>
