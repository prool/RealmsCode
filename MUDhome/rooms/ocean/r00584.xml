  <ShortDescription>You are admiring the scenery while casually walking along Leviathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road is the spectacular Ashton Falls Resort and
Inn, where a number of the more famous visitors to Oceancrest and even
a number of high powered officials stay from time to time to get away
from the chaos of life.  The magnificent resort overlooks the equally
impressive Ashton Falls (a waterfall), to which the resort is named after.</LongDescription>
