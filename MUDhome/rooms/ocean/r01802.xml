  <LongDescription>The entrance to the Advanced Archer's Archery Range is located on the
south side of the road.  This range is used by only the finest archers
in the land.  To prevent some embarassment, young archers are urged to
get permission before entering this area of the Dentra Archery Range.
Competition can be fierce, but always a lot of fun.</LongDescription>
