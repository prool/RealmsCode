  <ShortDescription>You are at a bend in the hallway which leads west and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway shows little signs of use, but has been kept very clean.
Looking down the hall to the west, you see several doors which open
out to the hallway, also two passages branch off to the south towards
the center of the vaults.  You begin to notice a distinct smell, you
aren't sure what it is, but should you proceed further in, you might
not want to know.</LongDescription>
