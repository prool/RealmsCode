  <ShortDescription>A stream cuts the road to the northwest, but vanishes quickly.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road continues to slope downward to the west and upward to the east.
This is a strange land, with a forest on the north and a desert on the
south.  There are stories in the city pubs of a nomadic race of people who
live on the K'tral, and of huge sandworms which burrough deep under the hot
dunes.  Looking across the desert you tend to not believe that anything
could live out there.</LongDescription>
