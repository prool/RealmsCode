  <ShortDescription>You are on a ledge which seems to circle around the inside of a glass bubble.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a frightening reddish light near the center of the interior, but
you would have to fly to get to it.  That is, if you wanted to get to it.
There's not much to this place except for that light.  What could it be
for, and what is it?  Why is it there?</LongDescription>
