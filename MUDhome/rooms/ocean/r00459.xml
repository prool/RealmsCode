  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hofton Avenue, north of the Oceancrest Library.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The impressive library is nothing compared to the University Library 
and the Ministry of Knowledge, but it does contain a number of mystical
tomes and dusty ledgers of boring city statistics.   Civilization only 
remembers what it wants to remember.</LongDescription>
