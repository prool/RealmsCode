  <LongDescription>You are almost at the same elevation as the gates to Castle Rutger.
The sheer wall of the castle makes you crane your neck to see the tops of
the turrets and spires, but several of them are lost in the clouds.  The
great gate closes at night, but there is a small door, suitable for one
person to use, beside the huge metal gate.  At night, after the gates close,
harpies have been known to attack people outside the castle.</LongDescription>
