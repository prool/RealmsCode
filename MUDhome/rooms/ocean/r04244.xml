  <ShortDescription>You are between the southern part of the courtyard and the center pool.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The reflecting pool to the north is a quiet place where some of the older
knights occasionally counsel the younger ones.  The pool is known to have
curative powers, and even the near-dead who have been brought to it have
been restored to full health.  On the south side you see a heavy equipment
storage area.</LongDescription>
