  <ShortDescription>You have entered Louis Brandywine Starrine's armor shoppe.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you walk through the door, you notice attractive pieces of small armor
hung on pegs all about the room.  Behind a counter in the back of the
shoppe stands a swarthy little man who looks as if he's probably killed a
few dragons in his day.  He only sells armor for small races.</LongDescription>
