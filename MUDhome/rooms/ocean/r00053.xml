  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Brownhaven Way, a major north-south street in the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the west is a high-class magic shoppe with a sign which seems to be
floating with no supports just above its entrance.  There is a quiet
little inn to the east where you can hear a group of people singing
and occasionally laughing.  Brownhaven Way has a great many trees along
the broad roadside, and the inn is set back away from the road.</LongDescription>
