  <ShortDescription>You continue walking along the western side of the mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trail is a soft earth and easily imprinted, but even so, whatever made
the footprints you see must be very heavy.  A short distance along the
path the footprints lead away from it.  Although man-sized, the markings
indicate that the creature which made them has only two large toes.  If
you look in the direction of the tracks you see the entrance to a cave
which was previously obscured by trees.</LongDescription>
