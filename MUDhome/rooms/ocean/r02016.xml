  <ShortDescription>You are in a small beer garden managed by a stout little dwarf named Hogoth.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This pleasant little beer garden has both indoor and outdoor drinking areas,
and is a favorite place for both travelers and locals in the afternoon and
evening.  Travelers can walk across the way from the stables to the north
and find good company here.  It's always nice to hear the latest stories of
adventure and catch up on the gossip.</LongDescription>
