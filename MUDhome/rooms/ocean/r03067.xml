  <ShortDescription>You are in the Ulandian Temple, inside a gloomy secret passage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage is rather broad here due to a missing section of the wall.
On the east side of the passage it looks like several stones have fallen
and revealed a nest of hextrils.  If you have never seen one before, you
are quite lucky.  They look like a land-dwelling octopus with a big head
and mouth, and six strong tentacles.  Luckily, their size is about like a
small cat.  Unluckily, they usually come in groups.</LongDescription>
