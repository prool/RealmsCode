  <ShortDescription>You are not far from the creek's banks, walking through tall grass.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Enchanted Forest is home to many races and animals, some rare, and some
very common, although it seems the common animals often have extraordinary
talents.  Even the trees around this lovely meadow somehow seem alive and
watchful as you make your way along the path.</LongDescription>
