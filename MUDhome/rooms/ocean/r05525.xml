  <ShortDescription>You are in the meeting room for a group of anti-royalists.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>These people are opposed to the concept of royalty, and want to inflame
the populace so as to overthrow the crown.  Most people simply ignore them.
Rumors are that they are responsible for many assassinations.  They used to
have a secret meeting place in the Dragon's Tooth Inn in Oceancrest, but
the city guard found them out and hanged the innkeeper.</LongDescription>
