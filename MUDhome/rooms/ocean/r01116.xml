  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Marina Way, west of the Davis Brothers Mortuary.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ironically, the Davis Brothers Mortuary is situated just south of the
Oceancrest Central Arena and Gaming Facility.  After the combat, the
deceased are brought here to be prepared for burial or cremation.  The
arena may be entered north of Overland Drive in the next city block.
A large building to the west seems to glow with an unusual blue-green
haze, which continues to puzzle you.</LongDescription>
