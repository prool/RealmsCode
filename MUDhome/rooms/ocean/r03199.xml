  <ShortDescription>Congratulations!  You have made it to the second level of the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Are you sure you want to be here?  The fabled Emerald Armor may be just
a myth, you know.  It seems to get more dangerous the deeper into the
underground city you descend.  But then, no pain no gain, right?  And
the Emerald Armor might actually be down here somewhere.  I say lets go
for it!  I'll be right back here behind you.</LongDescription>
