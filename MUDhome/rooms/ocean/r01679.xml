  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, north of the Grainery and Silos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Grainery and equally impressive silos on the south side of the
road store the year's crops for the devastating winter months.  Although
Oceancrest is close to the ocean, winter months can bring on some snow.
Nevertheless, it gets quite cold out and crops just don't grow when the
water doesn't even flow.</LongDescription>
