  <ShortDescription>You are on a path through the rose garden in the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a gardner stationed here to prevent anyone from picking the
beautiful blooms, as these are the roses used by the council in the
Kista Towers when they wish to discuss something in secret.  One of 
these roses is suspended over the meeting table, placing the members
under the rose, or "sub rosa."  The second level is northwest.</LongDescription>
