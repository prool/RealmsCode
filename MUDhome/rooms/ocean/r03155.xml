  <Name>Sunken Pirate Ship</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the starboard side, near the bow, of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Snap Dragon is a heavy man-o-war, and when it sailed the seas it
carried a complement of over 100 men, all of them mean and nasty pirates.
Often the mere sight of the ship on the horizon caused merchant captains
to abandon their ships and leave them to be plundered by Morgan's men.
It's been estimated that billions in gold and jewels have been carried
in the hold of this very ship.</LongDescription>
