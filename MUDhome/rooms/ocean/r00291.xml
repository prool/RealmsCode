  <ShortDescription>You have successfully made it to the training room.  Congratulations!</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>And now you should search your heart, and be absolutely certain that the
role of paladin is one you desire.  The paladin is a holy knight, and must
protect the weak and the rightious, and must never show fear of evilness.
As you advance farther, you will be called upon to fight against dark
forces, and must never flee from a such a fight.</LongDescription>
