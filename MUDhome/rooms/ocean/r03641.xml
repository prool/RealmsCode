  <ShortDescription>You are near a fiery hot blast furnace in the forge room deep in the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the foundry room where the heat is truly intense.  The forge gives
off a searingly bright light and a vast amount of heat.  Strong smiths
stand over their anvils shaping the great metal sheets into beautiful
pieces of armor.  West of here is the armory adet, while the arches lead
to the main armory of the castle.</LongDescription>
