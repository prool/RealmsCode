  <ShortDescription>You are in the main foyer of the Millwood Memorial Mayor's Office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Mayor's Office is the seat of power for the city, or so the people
who work there believe.  Mayor Millwood was in fact a very powerful mage
and therefore, when his time came, he did not feel like just giving up
and dying.  Although it cannot be proved that Millwood's experiment in
the afterlife worked, many people do belive that the Mayor still haunts
the office.  The first successor to Millwood was mysteriously killed 
(thought to have committed suicide) by a letter opener through his temple.
No one has since volunteered to be the next mayor.  Somehow or another,
though, things still get accomplished. </LongDescription>
