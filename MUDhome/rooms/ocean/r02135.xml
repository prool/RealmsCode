  <ShortDescription>You are on a rope bridge spanning the Ashton creek in the gorge below.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The old bridge sways with each step you take, forcing you to walk slowly
to keep it from going into wild oscillations and perhaps dumping you
into the water below.  Only one person at a time can be on the bridge,
but fortunately it doesn't look like you could be attacked easily while
here.  Unless the attack came from the air.  What's that overhead?</LongDescription>
