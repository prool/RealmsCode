  <ShortDescription>You are on stairs which connect Lelion Way to the beach area below it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>These are wide stone stairs, leading from Lelion Way above, to the Lelion
Beach and Park below.  You are half down or up, depending on which way
you are going, and the stairs form a landing here, and an observation
deck.  Looking north you see the Lithium Inlet, and across it you see
the northwest section of the city.  Going down will take you to the path
which leads west towards the Nylandian Bay.</LongDescription>
