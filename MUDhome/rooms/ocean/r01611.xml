  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, east of Thackery's Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Loud noises and laughter echo out of Thackery's Pub, located on the west
side of the road.  Although a bit run down and cockroach infested, it is
very popular amongst the poorer classes in town, and many farm workers
in the area like to gather there.  The food might be bad, but the wine
is excellent and the people make the atmosphere festive.</LongDescription>
