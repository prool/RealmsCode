  <ShortDescription>You are in the main post office for the village of Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's easy to see you are in a post office, because of all the postal workers
you see standing around doing absolutely nothing.  Fortunately the postal
system is almost completely automated, and you do not need these people to
send a letter.  You need to type:  sendmail &lt;person&gt; and then your message.
If you hit the return key twice, it will end the letter.  Be sure to hit
the return key at the end of each line.  There is no automatic line-wrap.
