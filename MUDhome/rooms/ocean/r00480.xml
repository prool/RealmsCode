  <ShortDescription>You are on Islandia Drive, walking on the south side of the Cathedral.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Various things might be said about the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss, but 
most of it isn't all that great.  This is primarily because the people 
don't fully understand the power of these great clerics and their purpose
in Oceancrest.  Without the Cathedral, it is likely the city would plunge
into the first level of hell, if not deeper.</LongDescription>
