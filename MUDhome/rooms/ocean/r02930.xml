  <ShortDescription>You are at the crossroads of a wide path and a small road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path goes through very thick woods to the north, while the small road
heads east and southwest.  Wagon tracks have made ruts in the road, but
it appears to be easy to walk.  A small rest area with a wooden table is
on the south side of the road.  A road sign says the city of Oceancrest is
to the southwest, and the home of Khallazar is to the east.  The elven city
of Hafnia is far to the northeast.</LongDescription>
