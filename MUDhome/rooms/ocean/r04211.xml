  <ShortDescription>You are at the southwest corner, on the ground floor, of Castle Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looks like several doors along here all go into the same place, a barracks
for the troops in the service of the castle.  In time of emergency, the 
several doors provide a fast exit for the knights inside.  There is a repair
shop for weapons and armor through the iron gate.</LongDescription>
