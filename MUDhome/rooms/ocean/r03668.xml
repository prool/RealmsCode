  <Name>Trokkawilff's Torture Chamber</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in an ancient torture chamber, no longer used.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This was once the pleasure chamber of Trokkawilff, the master torturer.
Although he has been dead for over a century and this place abandoned
since then, some say there are nights when one can still hear faint screams
coming from this part of the castle.  Several of the more common torture
devices are in evidence around the room, but you wonder what the bar-b-que
in the corner was used for.  Three iron maidens stand against the wall.
Directly south is a holding dungeon, open to view.  Trokkawilff liked
for his prisoners to see what he was doing to their compatriots.</LongDescription>
