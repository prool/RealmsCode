  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, south of the Farmer's Personal Residences.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not wanting to be like the rest of the community, the farmers decided 
that they would build themselves separated houses, instead of those
community housing facilities.  With the lack of space in the center of
the city, individual houses could not be build.  If people wanted to
live in the city, then they would have to live in the community housing
facilities.  They could always build a house outside the city walls, though.</LongDescription>
