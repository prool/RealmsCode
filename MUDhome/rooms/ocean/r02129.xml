  <Name>Dragons and Brimstone Exhibit</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a large room that tries to recreate the Valley of the Dragons
in the Enchanted Forest.  Strong adventurers might enjoy a trek into that
valley, and may find the dragons here rather young compared to the forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a number of dragons you've never seen before, but also several 
of your favorites.  This room is quite large and there are two very wide
exits to the east, one on the north side of the east wall and one on
the south side of the wall.  When the sign said "Brimstone", they meant it.
There are lots of hot rocks and what appears to be simulated lava flow.</LongDescription>
