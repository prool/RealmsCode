  <ShortDescription>You have entered the Barbarian Training Pits, where the barbarians 
test the skills and powers of their kind in mortal combat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The barbarian tribes do not like to promote their own kind without some
proof of their worthiness to live up to the barbarian codes of battle,
those being kill, maim, destroy.  If you wish to advance to the level
of Tribesman, you should enter the blue hut.  If you are already a 
Tribesman and wish to advance to second class, you should enter the
green hut.  If you wish to assume the highest ranking of Tribesman, first
class, you should enter the red hut.</LongDescription>
