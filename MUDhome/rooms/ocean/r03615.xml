  <LongDescription>Steps lead down to a cellar door which has been cut into an upper and lower
half.  The top half of the door is open, and you see the cellar appears to
be cool and dimly lighted.  A sign over the door says "Clerical Supplies."
The main courtyard to the south seems to have a number of tents and open
