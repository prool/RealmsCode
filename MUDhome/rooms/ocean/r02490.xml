  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of the desolate cavern filled with dust and cobwebs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dimly lit cavern doesn't appear to have supported any life of any kind
for the past century or so.  The dust is so heavy, it's likely to cover up
anything that might be lying around on the floor.  The hallway runs to
the north and east.</LongDescription>
