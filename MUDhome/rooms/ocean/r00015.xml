  <ShortDescription>Goldenrod Avenue continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a tall guard tower set in the wall on the north side of the road.
Stone steps inside an alcove look like they probably wind their way to the
top.  Several village guards can be seen up there, lounging around and
lazily watching the people below.  Looking to the west, on the south side
of the road, you can see the entrance to a pub.</LongDescription>
