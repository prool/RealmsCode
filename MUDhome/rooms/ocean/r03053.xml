  <ShortDescription>You are in a pitch dark passage near the western area of the goblin shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Your footsteps echo hollowly on hard stone as you make your way slowly
down the corridor.  It's difficult to tell just how big the passageway
might be, because you cannot see from edge to edge.  You pass several
doors as you walk as quietly as possible through this strange area.
Oddly, it sounds like snoring is coming from the doorway on the west side.</LongDescription>
