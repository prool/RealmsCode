  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Darmanian Way, between the Library and the Church.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Quite an odd combination, but the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss is located on
the south side of the road, while the Oceancrest Municiple Library is 
located on the north side.  Although not always at odds with each other,
there is usually quite a rift between science and the clergy, usually
resulting in violent riots.</LongDescription>
