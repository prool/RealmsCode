  <Name>Goblin Underground Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are traveling through a long shadowy tunnel in the southern
part of the goblin underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Torches flicker along the tunnel's walls providing the only means 
of light in the dark and dreary tunnel.  The air becomes increasingly 
stale as you travel deeper into the goblin's domain. Closer examination 
of the walls reveal the surface to be quite rough, and filled 
with numerous small cracks and crevices. It appears this tunnel was 
carved in haste by crude tools.  Then again goblins were never
known for their architectural skill.  The tunnel continues north,
deeper into the heart of the goblin shrine.</LongDescription>
