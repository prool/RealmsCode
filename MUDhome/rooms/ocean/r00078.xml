  <ShortDescription>You are in an armory, but everything you see is extra large.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Racks of different kinds of armor line the wall, but the sizes are enormous.
Even the owner here is a half-giant, and and he looks down on you from
his four meters of height.  He waits impatiently for you to either buy
something or leave.  Oh, yeah....   He doesn't approve of shoplifting. </LongDescription>
