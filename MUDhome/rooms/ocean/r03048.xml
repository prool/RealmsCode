  <ShortDescription>You are in the goblin's torture chamber.  Would you rather be elsewhere?</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A stretch rack is against one wall, and a hot brazier is against another,
with several orange-red pokers lying in the coals.  Chains with cuffs hang
from the ceiling, ready for service.  A vat of seething acid gives off
fumes that makes your eyes and nose burn.  Laid out on an instrument cart
are long needles, easily twenty centimeters in length, used to probe the
inner parts of eyes and ears and other body cavities.</LongDescription>
