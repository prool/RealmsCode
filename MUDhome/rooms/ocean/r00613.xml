  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Avatar Boulevard, west of the entrance to the plaza.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large center to the east is known as Neilian Plaza, which houses a 
number of specialty shops, including the Neilian Boat Rentals shop,
Fantine's Realm of Relics, Aaron's Armory, Loafy's Bakery and Leia's
Repair Shop.  Despite the marsh to the west, the center appears to be
doing fairly well.</LongDescription>
