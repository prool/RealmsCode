  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, west of the Panther Guard Headquarters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Panther Guards are a small subset of the city guard garrison, charged
with maintaining peace and order in this section of town.  Since most of
the buildings in this area are residential in nature, the Panther Guards
are more specially equiped to handle domestic affairs instead of street
violence.  On the west side of the road is a narrow, pink building called 
"Penelope's Musical Instruments" where bards and other minstrels can buy
various musical instruments to annoy people with.</LongDescription>
