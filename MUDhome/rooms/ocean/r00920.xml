  <ShortDescription>You are on Hafnia Circle road traveling around the city of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the most southern end of town.  The road curves back to the north
in both directions.  To the north is the business district of the city. 
This is the less well-to-do section of Hafnia, but a few artisans keep  
their shops here because of the low rent. A sign nearby says "Bowyer."</LongDescription>
