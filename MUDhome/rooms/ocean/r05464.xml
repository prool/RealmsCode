  <ShortDescription>You are on the south side of a guard post whose sentries block the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a tiny kiosk, painted with red and white stripes, standing at the
the side of the road.  A few meters away you see a barracks for the troops
that maintain this post.  A long pole has been lowered across the road,
apparently to require travelers to stop.  It would be easy to walk around. </LongDescription>
