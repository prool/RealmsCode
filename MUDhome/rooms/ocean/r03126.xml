  <ShortDescription>You are in the dining room of the Grinning Sailor Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This room is normally reserved for the older and wealthier clients of the
pub.  But since only pirates and other seafaring adventurers come here, it 
tends to be for officers only.  The low lamp light throws flickering 
shadows on the wall, making it difficult to see where you are going.   
Don't trip on some drunken bosun.  He might not understand.</LongDescription>
