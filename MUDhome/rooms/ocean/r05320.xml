  <ShortDescription>The hills to the east are home to many diverse races and odd people.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you travel along this wide highway, you sometimes spot a village on the
east side of the road, up in the foothills.  Wagon trails seem to be the
only way of getting there.  Looking southwest you see nothing but rocks 
and hot sand, although there are people reported to live there, too.</LongDescription>
