  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Marina Way, just north of Nagaritha Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nagaritha Drive is directly to the south of here.  On the east, you can
see the Regalia Convent, a large estate dedicated to the blasphemous 
monotheistic philosophy.  The only reason it even exists in Oceancrest
is because a wealthy resident wanted more diversity in the area of
religion and dedicated this building for its study.  There are large
oak doors on the east which lead into the Convent.</LongDescription>
