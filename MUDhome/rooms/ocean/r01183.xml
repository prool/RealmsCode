  <ShortDescription>You are on Netherworld Lane, west of the Main Entrance to the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Necropolis Avenue lies to the north, where the Main Entrance to the 
Necropolis is located.  You can see smoke rising from some building
to the south in the Necropolis.  You can only assume it's the smokestack
from the Crematorium, since nothing else should be burning, or giving
off that much black smoke.  On the north is Bushman Farms.  Reginald
Bushman is always looking for some unskilled labor to help him farm his
land.</LongDescription>
