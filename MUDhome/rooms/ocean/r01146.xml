  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Regalia Drive, just west of the Memorial Fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Memorial Fountain lies directly to the east, and is 
visited by most of the visitors to Oceancrest.  On the north side of
Regalia Drive is the Temple of the Rising Moon.  The priests of the
Rising Moon are dedicated towards balance and harmony.  This order is
very druidic.  However, the moon also represents the forest and the hunt,
thus many hunters and trackers also visit to gain the priests' blessings.
On the south side of the road is the Shrine of the Protectors, which is 
more of a monument than a religious shrine.</LongDescription>
