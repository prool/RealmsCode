  <ShortDescription>The north-south path curves near the southern end of the Fighter's Hall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Walk of Lords is farther to the south and is a glittering display of
the adage that you can take it with you.  The Walk of Lords is a wonderful
testimonial to the power of money, and the rich and powerful families of
Oceancrest.  The path continues both north and south from here.</LongDescription>
