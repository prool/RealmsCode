  <ShortDescription>You are near the eastern gates of the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A giant arch overhangs the gates of the city.  A majority of the city
was created by elves when they fled from the dragons hundreds of years
ago.  Since then, humans have wandered in and enjoyed the hospitality
the elves have to offer.  Perhaps you can help them reclaim the lost
city of Caledonia from the dragons.</LongDescription>
