  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow crawl space, above a hole leading to a prison cell.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see several criminals below you, and a black crawlway leading to
the east.  The stones are cold and clammy, and  you can hear rats in the
distance.  Big rats.  It's hard to make a decision as to which is worse,
hungry rats or hungry prisoners.  Which way to go?</LongDescription>
