  <ShortDescription>Wall Road West runs between the western wall and an animal training compound.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are some very strange beasts kept in there, and not all of them
are happy to be there.  The noise can be horrendous at times.  The 
Brownhaven militia has given the owner of the compound a contract to
train copper dragons as mounts.  When its done properly, they make 
excellent steeds for flying patrols high over the village.  When its
not done properly, the dragons eat their riders.  It's a tough life.</LongDescription>
