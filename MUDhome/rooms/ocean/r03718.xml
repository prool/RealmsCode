  <Name>Lyanden Tomb Portico</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a floating portico just outside the Lyanden Tomb entrance.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You hover in the air a few meters above the ground, held by magic.   
The portico you are under shelters you somewhat from the chill wind
and wet mist, but you cannot seriously be thinking of entering the
tomb of the Lyanden family, can you?  Kings lie in stately rest inside,
but surely you will disturb them if you enter.</LongDescription>
