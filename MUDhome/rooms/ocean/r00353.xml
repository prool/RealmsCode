  <Name>Rum Road/Long Dock Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Rum Road and the Long Dock.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At the southern end of Rum Road you see the island's famous dwarven
distillery where the finest and strongest rum is made.  Both sides of the
road have an equal number of garish pubs and saloons, and a great deal
of noise is coming from them all.  Standing by itself at the north end
of the road is a bright red house.  Quite a few women of all races are
hanging out the windows and lolling on the veranda.  They don't seem to
be wearing much in the way of clothes, and they seem to know a lot of
the sailors and pirates walking nearby.</LongDescription>
