  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Hofton Avenue, in the northeastern section of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Despite the heavy military presence in the area, the northeastern quadrant
of town tends to be the rowdiest of them all.  Numerous nightclubs and
bars line the streets, filled with officers and enlisted men after a long
day at work. They tend not to be in very good moods.  You might think
twice before entering any bar on this side of the town.</LongDescription>
