  <Name>Entrance to Eldritch's Tomb</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You get a feeling of immensity from standing before the tomb.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Great white pillars surround the entrance to Eldritch's Tomb.  There
is a cosmic aura about this place, like it is etherially connected
with another plane of existance.  It could be your imagination, but
every now and then, you feel blessed, perhaps by Eldritch himself.</LongDescription>
