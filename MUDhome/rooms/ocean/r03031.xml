  <Name>Underground Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a long underground passage, near the goblin underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage is devoid of light, and twists and turns every few meters.
The goblins built the tunnels down here for their use, but recognized
that in case of an invasion from above, twists and turns would make it
difficult for invaders to move quickly.  A trickle of sewage runs down
the center of the floor, making the floor a little slippery with slime.</LongDescription>
