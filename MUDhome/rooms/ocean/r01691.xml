  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, running east and west through town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road, you can see the numerous silos used by
the farmers to store the corn and wheat for the dangerous winter months
when literally nothing is growing.  Careful planning prevents famines
and starvation even under the worse conditions.  Although Oceancrest 
borders an ocean, it is far enough north that all the air that gets 
brought down this far is very cold.  It is not uncommon for temperatures
to go below zero.</LongDescription>
