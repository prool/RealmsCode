  <ShortDescription>Golden Dolphin Way extends east and west, parallel to the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The omnimous City Walls lie directly to the south of you.  They must
be nearly ten meters high, if not more.  The walls were built ages ago
and have proved their worth many times.  In addition to keeping invaders
out, they have also been proven to keep thieves and other vermin in,
making them easier to capture.  It is almost impossible to scale the 
City Wall from either side.</LongDescription>
