  <ShortDescription>This is a private passage used long ago by the priests who resided here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>there is a black hole in the floor which you must be careful of, if you
want to continue making your way through this passage.  There is also a
soft hissing sound occasionally coming from the hole.  Around the edges
of the opening you see the bones of rats and ettercaps, as though they
had been tossed there from down below.</LongDescription>
