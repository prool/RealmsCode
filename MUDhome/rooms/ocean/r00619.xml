  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the Shrine of Life and Death.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The symbolic Shrine of Life and Death is the single most important shrine
in Oceancrest for all clerics despite their individual diety of worship.
All religion is based on the cycle of life and death, and the balance 
between the two.  Understanding this fundamental cycle is the first step
towards understanding one's own religion.</LongDescription>
