  <ShortDescription>You are walking around a very large mountain in the Nellan Mountain Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you round the northern side of the mountain, you can see down into
the Ituk Glacier.  The glacier is particularly dangerous because one
can easily become quite lost in such a place.  Scavenging animals are
always on the prowl for stranded and helpless prey.  The most dangerous
of these animals is the white dragon, which is quite common up here.</LongDescription>
