  <ShortDescription>You are in a long narrow tunnel.  The walls are cold to the touch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the dampness makes a great environment for slime and bacteria growth which
probably isn't good for your health.  Everything you touch seems to be slick
with some sort of nasty, living slime.  This tunnel is very confusing, too.</LongDescription>
