  <LongDescription>Riverdell Way runs north and south through the intersection with Neilian
Drive, which runs east and west.  There is a large forest on both sides
of the western part of the road.  The thick brush and trees make it hard
to see what's inside, if indeed there is something inside.</LongDescription>
