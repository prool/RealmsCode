  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, south of the Klondike Wheat Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vast wheat fields seem to extend for miles to the east and west.  On
the southern side of the road, you can see some of the individual houses
used by the farmers and their families.  The personal residences are unique
because they are separated; most housing in the city is communal due to 
the lack of space for individual houses.  However, the communal housing
is relatively spacious, so there isn't much complaining.</LongDescription>
