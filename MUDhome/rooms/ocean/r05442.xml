  <ShortDescription>You are on a part of the road to Hafnia often called Kerston's Bank.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are low banks on both sides of the road, but that's not the reason 
for the name.  Kerston the highwayman and his band of robbers consider this
lonely area to be their personal source of funds, hence Kerston's Bank.</LongDescription>
