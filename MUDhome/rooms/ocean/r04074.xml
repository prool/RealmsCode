  <ShortDescription>You are on North Highway, passing by the eastern side of Golgoth Mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Deep crevices and valleys run east to west on the eastern side of the
Highway.  They appear to form a labrynth of interconnecting passages
where one might become lost, were he to venture into them.  An old map
tacked to the wall of the Boar's Arse Pub marks this area as the home
of a large number of hobbits.</LongDescription>
