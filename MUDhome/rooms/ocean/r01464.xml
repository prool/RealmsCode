  <LongDescription>The main hallway is used by the servants and maids to bring food and
refreshments down from the kitchen to the lounge and recreation room.
The mages and their guests often use it as well to show them around
the palace and to direct them to their quarters.  The hallway 
continues to the north and south.  You can see the large balcony 
overlooking the island to the north.</LongDescription>
