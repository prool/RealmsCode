  <Name>Secret Crypt Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret crypt passage somewhere behind the main crypt.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small, secret passage is so small, only you can get through it.
The others in your party will have to wait for you to get out before
they can come in after you.  You just hope there's something good
at the other end of the passage.</LongDescription>
