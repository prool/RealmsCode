  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Regalia Drive and Marina Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Regalia Way runs west from here towards the Oceancrest Memorial Fountain
and eventually reaches the western City Wall.  Marina Way runs north to
south.  The Regalia Convent is located to the east of Marina Way.  It
is a strange religious order as the nuns and priestesses strongly 
believe in a monotheistic philosophy, thus are often shunned by other
religious orders.  The entrances to the Convent are located to the north
and south of here.</LongDescription>
