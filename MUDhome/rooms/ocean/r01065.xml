  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just west of the Ministry of Truth building.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The monumental building on the east side of the street is known throughout
the city as the Oceancrest Ministry of Truth.  The ministry verifies every
fact it can, and tries to define life and death in a philosophic sense.
Unfortunately, no one in the Ministry of Truth can figure out what their
compatriots are talking about, and as a consequence they have decided that
all things are both true and false at the same time.  The result of this is
that the Ministry of Truth is considering opening a Ministry of Untruth to
balance the philosphy they seek to impose on the citizens.</LongDescription>
