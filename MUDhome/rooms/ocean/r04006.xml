  <ShortDescription>You are in a hallway under Natasha's mausoleum.  It connects to a cellar. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>No one has been here in a long time, as you can see by the dust and cobwebs.
Under the dust there is a heap of old bones, and if you are not careful,
your own may be there also.  There is an animal-like smell coming from the
cellar, and its not very plesant.  </LongDescription>
