  <LongDescription>Natasha de Allisk is thought to be one of the last remaining vampires in
Oceancrest, most of the others being vanquished some decades ago by some
overly pompus paladins who didn't like the way the vampires were killing
the children.  Natasha escaped capture by putting a curse on her Mansion
making it nearly impossible to reach her.  She also built the Allisk 
Labyrinth to provide an accessible escape for her vampire brothers and
sisters.</LongDescription>
