  <ShortDescription>You are in the large granary facility for the town of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The granary is a storage facility for grains and rices.  Since the
forests around Kista are not capable of producing grains, they are
often imported from towns such as Brownhaven where corn and wheat
almost grow naturally.  This facility stores these grains as supply
lines are not very reliable and caravans might not arrive for as long
as six months at a time.</LongDescription>
