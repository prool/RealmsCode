  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, east of the Sacred Temple of Lolth.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Drow are fairly rare in Oceancrest, but the center to the west provides
worship places for more exotic and less accepted religious icons.  Most
of these dieties are not widely accepted by most of the people, but there
are always the curious and a few lost Drow wandering around.  Lolth is
the spider queen of the drow elves.</LongDescription>
