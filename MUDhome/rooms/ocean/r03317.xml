  <ShortDescription>You are on the path which leads west and around the fountain to the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A white, great marble fountain looks appealing.  Maybe you can rest there
from the chilling breeze which whistles through a small grove of dead and
ugly looking trees to the south.  The low, white building appears to be the 
administration building, where you will go to arrange a resting place for
your companions if you make it out.</LongDescription>
