  <ShortDescription>You find yourself in a long hallway heading north and ending with a closed
and locked door to the south.  The air is very stale, but breathable.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway is finely crafted out of the rock and ice into square edges
which makes walking around very easy.  The long hallway continues as far
north as you can see.  To the south is a strange door seemingly in the
middle of nowhere.  It appears to be locked, but shouldn't be too hard
to pick.</LongDescription>
