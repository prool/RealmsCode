  <ShortDescription>You are on the main assembly floor for the fighting forces of Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It is here that troops are called to muster every morning, and once a month
an inspection of the fighting men and women takes place.  The inspection is
generally a lot of pomp and ceremony, but woe to the soldier who doesn't
pass.  A week in the castle's dungeon with only water and crusty bread is
no fun.  Further to the south is the review stand and the drummer's kiosk.</LongDescription>
