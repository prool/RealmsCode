  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, a long road connecting the two sides of the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south of Hillcrest Drive resides the Walk of Heroes monument, which
is primarily just a lush, green park with numerous bronze and marble 
statues of heroes past and present.  There is a large building on the
north side of Hillcrest which seems to glow with a magical aura.  
Unfortunately, there's nothing much to distinguish it from this point
of view.  </LongDescription>
