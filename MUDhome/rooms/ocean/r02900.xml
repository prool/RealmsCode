  <ShortDescription>You have reached a small room far below the surface of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This strange room located next the the hidden level of the Pits of Doom
answers the question of where the monsters come from that inhabit this
unholy place.  Before you is a large gate which appears to take you to
some dark place deep within the bowels of the universe itself.  What
lies beyond the gate may not even be of this world.  The gate radiates
a faint goldish glow, and will not allow you to take anything beyond it.</LongDescription>
