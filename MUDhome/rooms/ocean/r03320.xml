  <ShortDescription>You are on the Necropolis path, just to the west of the fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path here passes to the north of a grove of trees.  To the north,
you see a large expanse of ground covered by tombstones belonging to
commoners who were buried there.  The stones are not large or fancy, 
but each has its own special meaning to the family of the deceased.</LongDescription>
