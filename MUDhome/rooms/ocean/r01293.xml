  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the eastern bank of a small but broad waterfall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ashton creek is very wide at this point as it continues to flow
toward the Ashton river to the south.  Great boulders give way to
gravel toward the south, and tall, stately trees are on both sides
of the stream.  Across the creek is a yellow stone cottage in a 
cleared area.</LongDescription>
