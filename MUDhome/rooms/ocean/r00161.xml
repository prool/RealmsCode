  <ShortDescription>This is the disposal pits for the village of Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Constant fires burn here twenty four hours a day, every day.  Not only does
the garbage of the village get burned, but since there is such a limited
amount of space in the cemetery, many of the poor who die also wind up here,
thrown on some garbage pile waiting to be torched.  Rats and some larger
animal you cannot quite identify seem to be running in all directions, 
looking for food.</LongDescription>
