  <ShortDescription>You are in Poor alley, jostling with beggers and elderly people.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a chapter of the Begger's Guild on the west side of this disgusting
throughfare, and an open door on the east side is a Conjurer's Guild.  The
beggers coming out of the guild seems to be mostly maimed and blind, but
some get around amazingly well in spite of their apparent handicap.  A very
strong and unpleasant odor wafts on the breeze.</LongDescription>
