  <ShortDescription>You are outside the Lyanden Militia Outpost Headquarters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The headquarters is built in one of the old watch towers that once served
as a signal station.  Long ago, when trolls apppeared, guards lit fires on 
top of the towers to signal an invasion.  Now, of course there is a much
more modern way of signaling.</LongDescription>
