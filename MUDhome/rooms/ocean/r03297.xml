  <ShortDescription>You are just to the south of the gate by which you entered.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You stand a short walk to the south of the gate which so rudely closed
behind you upon entering the magical garden.  There is a path which leads
to the north and south, but if no one is looking, you can hop over a row 
of strange looking flowers to the west or climb over a tranquil little brook
to the east which comes out of nowhere and probably ends nowhere also.
To the south you see a statue which stands in a small clearing.</LongDescription>
