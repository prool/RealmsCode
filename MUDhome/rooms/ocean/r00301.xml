  <ShortDescription>You have entered Ogre's fighting area for barbarians and fighters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ogre's Play Pen appears to be a rather old but well kept building
of stone and brick.  Many years have passed since the days of the
legendary adventures of the two Brownhaven heros, Ogre the barbarian and
his comrade in arms, the wise cleric Lorinin.  Now the tales of
Ogre are mostly unknown. In his retirement, Ogre used his fortune
to build a place for barbarians and fighters to play and practice.
To the north, you see a sign for "Bashing Unlimited" and to the south
another sign saying "Arena". </LongDescription>
