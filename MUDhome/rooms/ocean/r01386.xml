  <ShortDescription>You are in the main dungeon hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>By the smell of things, you think something just died.  In fact, it's
just the kitchen cooking up some grub for the prisoners.  Forcing them
to eat that food is probably enough torture for one person.  The door
to the north is inscribed "Inquisition Room/Authorized Use Only".  The
door looks like it's bolted shut.</LongDescription>
