  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Evenborough Way, south of the Evenborough Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The grassy green park stands as a reminder of what nature is like and how
it must be preserved.  Since the city is surrouned by a large city wall, not
many people ever leave the city to explore the wilderness.  Small parks like
this one serve as a substitute.  On the south side of the road, you can see
the Evermore Development Agency, a large group of architechs that manages
the building of new buildings in Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
