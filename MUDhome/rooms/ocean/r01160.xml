  <ShortDescription>You are traveling around the eastern portion of Khelleva Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Khelleva Circle continues to the northwest and southwest.  Rosecrest
Street branches out from the circle to the northeast and Khelleva 
Drive, which runs past the Khelleva Mansion, branches to the southeast.
The large circle was built by the Khelleva Family a couple of decades
ago to alleviate traffic around their home and also to give some 
support to the income-poor city.</LongDescription>
