  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Kafkan Way, just south of the Founder's Fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a rather nice-looking fountain on the north side of the road on
the Iilandi University campus.  The fountain has been dedicated to the 
founding pioneers in the sciences.  The University gives out an award
each year on the basis of science, and new inductees get their names put
on the plaques around the fountain.</LongDescription>
