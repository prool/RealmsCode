  <LongDescription>The magnificent Temple of Ahto pays homage to the powerful God of the
Seas and Waters.  The god Ahto was worshiped by many of the northern folk
living on the northern island Rustallik'n.  These people often traded with
the people of Oceancrest, and some started migrating here.  Nevertheless,
Ahto became a major icon to the sailors and seamen who live day to day on
the open seas.</LongDescription>
