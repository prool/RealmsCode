  <ShortDescription>You are on East Ulandia, near the east bank of the Baldywyne River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Most of the bank for as far as you can see is lush and green, but for
some reason, there's no vegetation here.  The ground looks absolutely
sterile, without even a weed growing.  In places it even looks scorched.
The Brownhaven South Bridge is just up the road to the north, and this
unhappy condition seems to extend to the underside of the bridge.</LongDescription>
