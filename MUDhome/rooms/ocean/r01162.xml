  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just north of the Oceancrest Central Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The famous arena is the home of numerous gladiators and fearsome foes who
are there to test the skills of brave adventurers.  The entrance to the
Central Arena is located off of either Marina Way to the west or Eidenhoft 
Boulevard to the east.  There is a strange looking building on the north of 
Rosecrest Street with a large gem above it, radiating a purple hue over the
building and parts of the street.</LongDescription>
