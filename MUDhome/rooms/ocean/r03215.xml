  <ShortDescription>You are near the north leg of the road around the beautiful Lake Kista. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not far from here is another road that heads north to the Gotland Pass.
Lake View Road continues to the northwest not far from here, and will
eventually turn back to the south and return to Kista.  The view of the 
lake is very good from this height.  In the drinking rooms back in the
city there are stories of monsters who inhabit the lake.  How silly.</LongDescription>
