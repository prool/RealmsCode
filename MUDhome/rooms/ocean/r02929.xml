  <Name>Short Valley</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a short, wooded valley in the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the trees are not very thick here in the valley, but they are strange.
Each one seems to have a door and windows cut into it, and some very small
people apparently live here.  There is a stream near the western edge of
the valley, and several of the small folk are setting fish nets.  A lilting
music seems to pervade the valley, although faintly.  The path you are on
continues north and south.  An almost unseen path heads west.</LongDescription>
