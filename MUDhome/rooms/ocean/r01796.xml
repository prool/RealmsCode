  <ShortDescription>You are wandering along Hillcrest Drive, north of the Melbourne Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The fantastic Melbourne Entertainment Arena is designed to amuse the law-
abiding citizens by throwing criminals and other degenerates into the 
pits to battle gladiators and sometimes lions.  The spectators are often
given stones to throw at the people in the arena if things get a little
boring.  On the north side of the road is Imeldia's Potions and Stuff
arguably a magic shop.</LongDescription>
