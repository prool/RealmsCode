  <ShortDescription>You are on the great circular floor of the Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dark and forbidding archways lead to old hallways and forgotten rooms.
A stone stairway spirals around the tower, leading to the roof.   Everywhere
you look, you see fire damage.  The fire must have been very intense, as
even the metal hand rail has melted into a grotesque pile of sludge.</LongDescription>
