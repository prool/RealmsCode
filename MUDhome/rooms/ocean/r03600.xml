  <Name>Outer Drawbridge for Castle Ragnar</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You stand at the outer edge of a great drawbridge for Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The great bridge is not lowered during the night to keep out trolls. 
A massive gate is on the other side, and guards can be seen on the parapet
directly above the it.  Several guards also stand near the entrance.  The
castle seems to soar into the clouds, and its upper turrets are lost to
sight.  On either side of the bridge are the quiet waters of the moat, 
broken by bubbles rising to the surface at several places.</LongDescription>
