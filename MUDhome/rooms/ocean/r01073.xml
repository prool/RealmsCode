  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just west of a nightclub-like building.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In mysterious glowing letters, the words "Silk Dreams" lights up the
sky and the building to the east.  There appears to be a lot of activity
in the building, but it looks like access is pretty restrictive.  There
is a burly bouncer at the door into the building that doesn't look like
he's having that good of a time watching people walk by.</LongDescription>
