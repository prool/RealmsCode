  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you bob up and down in the water, you occasionly see what look to be
great cliffs in the distance to the north.  The distance is so great that
you can't really be sure, but isn't it worth the effort to swim in that
direction?</LongDescription>
