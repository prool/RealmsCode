  <Name>Alturis Road/Ivory Way Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Alturis Road, which goes west from here, and
Ivory Way, running north and south.  The amphitheater is to the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large amphitheater to the east is very impressive and actually fills with
customers if someone of interest comes to entertain the citizens.  This does
not happen as often as the council would like, but it's a great revenue for
lesser known minstrels who are traveling between towns.  To the south is
the great Hanging Gardens monument.  Annetol Way is to the southeast.</LongDescription>
