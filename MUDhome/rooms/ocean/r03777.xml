  <ShortDescription>You are in a grove of cypress trees on the south bank of the Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees get denser to the south and the east, forming a dark, shadowy
canopy where you hear small sounds unlike anything you have ever heard
in a forest before.  The walkway, however, is broad and well maintained
by the groundskeepers here in the park.</LongDescription>
