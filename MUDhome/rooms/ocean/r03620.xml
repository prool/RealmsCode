  <Name>Western Courtyard</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the western side of the great courtyard in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a wide set of stone stairs winding out of sight in a turret here.
the stairs look wide enough for a great many people to go up or down at
the same time, so its probably meant for the fast deployment of troops to
the upper reaches of the castle.  High overhead is a beam canterlevered
over the courtyard, with a block and tackle arrangement and ropes and
chains hanging from it.  Looks like some very heavy equipment has been 
hoisted to the top of the turret.  the courtyard continues to the north
and south, and a larger area is directly east.</LongDescription>
