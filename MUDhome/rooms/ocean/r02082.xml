  <Name>Lord Aaileman's Personal Chambers</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in Lord Aaileman's personal chambers.  Aaileman is the head of 
the Kista Council of Law and Order, dedicated to peace among the races.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The chambers are about ten meters wide and long, covered with ornate
golden trinkets and other items that appear to have no real bearing
on anything.  There are a couple of small statues and models of new
cities being planned.  There's also a large map of the region of 
Kista.  Aaileman is usually in his chambers, here, but sometimes 
he's in the throne room or talking in the council chambers.</LongDescription>
