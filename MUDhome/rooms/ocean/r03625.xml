  <ShortDescription>You are on the main assembly floor near the review stand of Prince Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The review stand is covered with bunting and flags, and has a great many
box seats for the important people who sit here.  In the center is a dais
a little higher than the rest of the stand with a massive throne on it.
Nearby is an open-air drummer's kiosk.  The area is large enough for all
of the castle's troops to assemble here, and room for visitors to stand
to the sides.</LongDescription>
