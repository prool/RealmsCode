  <ShortDescription>Orchard Lane continues to the east and west through the quiet forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Wit the exception of the trickling stream to the east, you can't here
much in this dense forest.  It's quite odd that the forest exists in the
middle of the large city.  For some reason, the city decided to keep the
forests intact, building the city around them.</LongDescription>
