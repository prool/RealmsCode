  <ShortDescription>You are on a dirt road going through the Chateau Richland Winery fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road has been in use for a long time and is bare of weeds.  It is
apparently used fairly often.  There is a mid-day rest area immediately
to the north, and in the distance to the east you see a large grove of
trees.  Several farm buildings lie to the southwest.</LongDescription>
