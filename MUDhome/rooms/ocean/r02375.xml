  <ShortDescription>You are in a small, cramped igloo located slightly below the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oddly, the igloo you see lies slightly below the plane of the glacier,
leading into the massive chunk of ice.  There is a heavy, metal door
located to the north with a new lock on it.  There is no key around
that you can see, and the door looks like it's been undisturbed for
ages.</LongDescription>
