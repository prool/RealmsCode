  <ShortDescription>This is a vacant plot of burial ground.  Did you wander off the path?</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking around you notice that it really isn't just a vacant plot of
ground at all.  There is a depression in the earth, as though a grave
had been dug up and the dirt removed was not enough to fill in the hole.
Whatever monument was here, which might have told you who's grave was
descrated, has been removed.  You get an uneasy feeling about the area,
and decide that perhaps it may not be safe to stay here.</LongDescription>
