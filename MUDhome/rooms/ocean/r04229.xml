  <ShortDescription>You are in the Level One Hallway, near the castle armory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The armory is a little farther to the east where you see the sentry guard.
The more expensive and better weapons are stored in the armory, so several
guards keep an eye on them.  Many people visit the castle who are not
actually part of the castle's company, and a few seem to be accomplished
theives.  Equipment has been found missing more than once.</LongDescription>
