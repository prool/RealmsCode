  <ShortDescription>The Swallow's Nest can be seen on the north side of Orchard Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are walking casually along Orchard Lane, looking for a little excitement.
The Swallow's Nest is a rather large bar for some rather large people,
and might be the excitement you've been looking for.  The Swallow's Nest
is an exclusive club for city guard officers, so it is unlikely that your
presence there will be welcome.</LongDescription>
