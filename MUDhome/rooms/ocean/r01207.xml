  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Main Street, south of the Reclaimation Plant.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Oceancrest Central Recycling Plant and Reclaimation Center,
a fancy name for a dump, is used to collect old and used up trash from 
all over the city.  There are smaller collection sites around the 
city, but they all end up here eventually.  Most of the equipment that
finds its way here usually ends up as scrap metal, used to create new
weapons at a cheaper cost.</LongDescription>
