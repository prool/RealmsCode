  <ShortDescription>Only the finest chain mail and metallic armors are on display here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evander's foundry specializes in metallic armors and some weapons.  You 
won't find any cloth or leather supplies here.  Only the finest metals and
materials go into these fine armors.  Evander's Armory is about the only
armory in town that also uses adamantine metal to make their scale mail.
Although scale mail is less protective than chain, it lasts significantly
longer than virtually all other conventional metals.</LongDescription>
