  <ShortDescription>You are near the great pits that are home to the copper dragons.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Copper dragons are easily trained to accept a rider, and the Brownhaven
Guards, who form the village's militia, have commissioned the administration
here to do just that.  The skies are full of monsters and the guards
must constantly patrol in order to keep some hapless citizen from being
plucked from the streets and eaten.  Close aerial combat is not advisable,
so the dragons are fitted with a long lance mounted on the saddle for the
rider's use.  This place is heavily guarded.</LongDescription>
