  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern hallway of a fire-blackened old castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A lot of structural damage occurred here during the battle between the
Archmage Tellia Aphrotine and the two dark powers that lived here.  One
part of the wall has collapsed, and ceiling beams hang at odd angles,
casting deep shadows.  A low wail can be heard down the hall.</LongDescription>
