  <ShortDescription>You are on the Ogden Villa Estate, in the carriage lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>South of you is the front entrance to the Ogden Family home, and north
along the carriage lane is the main gate.  To the west are the spacious
grounds and gardens.  If you have not been invited you are considered a
trespasser, and trespassers are often killed on sight. The rich really
