  <Name>Mountain Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking around the Nellan Mountain Range near the Ituk Glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mountain trail leads through the mountains towards the Ituk Glacier,
a massive piece of ice that seems to grow higher each year.  The glacier
is a potentially dangerous place in that it is very easy to get lost in
such a massive wasteland.  It would be wise to have a good ranger guiding
your party.</LongDescription>
