  <ShortDescription>This is the eastern interior wall of the Tower of Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway branches to the north and south from here, or you can go east
toward the castle's main courtyard, where most of the castle activity took
place during a happier time.  The Witch of Kayleigh murdered the duke who
once owned this castle, and drove his followers into the forest.</LongDescription>
