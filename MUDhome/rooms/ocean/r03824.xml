  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the middle platform, above the Center Ring.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the platform shared by both trapeze artists and tightrope walkers.
It is much larger than the other two platforms and a little higher.  A large
ladder is the only way down from here.  You can make out people cheering
in the audience and performers in the rings below.  Some of them are pointing
in your direction.  They are probably wondering why you are up here, and why
you don't have a costume on.  The trapeze looks like the safest way to exit
from here.  Maybe if you were quite dextrous, you could walk across the
highwire.</LongDescription>
