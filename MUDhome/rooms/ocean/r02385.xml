  <Name>Cavern Cliff</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of one of the caverns deep within the planet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south you can see a cliff, but beyond that there is nothing but
blackness.  It's the great abyss.  It's going to be impossible to cross
it without some serious help.  Far overhead is a great ice cap which is
slightly luminous, but apparently very thick and several thousand meters
away.  You have descended to a much deeper level than when you came in.</LongDescription>
