  <ShortDescription>There is a vast valley below you, and a winding road above and below.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One turn on this road looks pretty much like another, but at the turn
below you see where a game trail crosses the road, and heads north.  The
trail looks recently used, and you have heard there are magical stag deer
that roam here.  The horns of the stag are said to give life to the almost
dead, and help the ill recovery with fantastic speed.</LongDescription>
