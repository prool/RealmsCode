  <ShortDescription>You are in an overturned cart where Danzig the Powermonger resides.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This cart is quite a sight.  Danzig sits on his throne, a wooden
chair in the center of this reasonable large cart, which has been turned o
over and built up to form a simple room with four walls with a 
piece of heavy cloth over the doorway.  Danzig is a leader among the
outlaws that you met on your way through the thicket, but he thinks
he is a king.</LongDescription>
