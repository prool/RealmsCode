  <ShortDescription>You are on Ivory Way between the Althemanian Campus and a small pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The pub seems to enjoy the patronage of the many graduate students who do
research over at the college.  Once they get out of the lab, they seem to be
no different than the undergraduates in Oceancrest.  Always drinking.
Randolf Lane is south of here.</LongDescription>
