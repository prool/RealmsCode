  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Monument Avenue and Leviathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This rather busy intersection forms the southeastern border of the Keslar
Mountain, which was built artificially by the Keslarian Mages as a show

Holy Order of the White Rose, where young Paladins go to get their basic
training and skills.</LongDescription>
