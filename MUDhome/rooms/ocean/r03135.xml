  <Name>The Pink Drake Inn</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a rowdy little inn named after some local fauna.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look around you notice that most of the patrons seem to be Orcs.
Even the bartender and the serving girls are Orcs, but there are a few
other races here.  Most of the noise sounds to be coming from a betting
table set up near a veranda overlooking an outdoor pit.  A lot of high
pitched hissing and growling seems to be heard from directly below the
crowd gathered on the veranda.  When you look closer, you realize there
are pink drakes in a fighting pit down there!</LongDescription>
