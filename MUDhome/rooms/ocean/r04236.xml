  <ShortDescription>You are in the private quarters of Commander Franchot, friend of Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Franchot singlehandedly once slew two red dragons in a battle that lasted
three days.  He came upon the beasts in the Valley of Dragons while they 
were mating and was able to strike the first blow, but mighty was their
anger at being interrupted, and he suffered greatly, but he did kill them.</LongDescription>
