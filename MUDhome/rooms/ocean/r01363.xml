  <ShortDescription>Neilian Drive cuts through two dense forest regions on both sides.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Two dense forests are separated by Neilian Drive as it cuts through the
thick brush.  It is unsure whether or not there was a natural break between
the two forests or whether the forest was carved out to make way for this
bypass.  No one ever seems to enter or exit from the forests, so it would
seem that no one would care.</LongDescription>
