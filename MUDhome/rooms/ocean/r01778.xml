  <ShortDescription>You are on Netherworld Lane, just east of Leviathan Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side of the road, you can see the Riverdell Tranquility Park
and the Riverdell Center for Tracking Training.  Being as large as it is,
the Riverdell Park is ideal for studying the skills of tracking and 
searching in the rather dense woods.  On the north side of the road is the
Rodaisl Community Housing Complex, where numerous Oceancrest residents
live.  There are no houses within the city, so if people wish to live 
inside the city, they must live in one of the housing complexes.</LongDescription>
