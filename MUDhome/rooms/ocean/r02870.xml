  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the home of Mardic Kaldeas, illusionist.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the famed Kaldeas Mansion of Illusion.  Not all is what it appears
to be, once you enter this place.  The place is reputed to be empty, but
that may not be true.  From here, near the front door, you can see the
rooms apparently have a large number of mirrors in them.</LongDescription>
