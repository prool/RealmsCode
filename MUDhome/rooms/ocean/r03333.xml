  <ShortDescription>The path continues in a long sweep to the west and the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Lyanden Tomb, last resting place of the great kings who built and
lived in the Lyanden Castle, is farther to the south.  The grounds near
here are especially well kept, and there is a quality of serenity you
have not experienced since you came into the Necropolis grounds.</LongDescription>
