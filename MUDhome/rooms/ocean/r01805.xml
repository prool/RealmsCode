  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, just north of the Beginner's Archery Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dentra Central Archery Range is divided into two separate ranges so
that the experienced archers don't have to deal with the inexperienced ones
at the same target range.  You are in front of the main entrance to the
Beginner's Archery Range where a number of younger archers and their tutors
are practicing and improving their skills.</LongDescription>
