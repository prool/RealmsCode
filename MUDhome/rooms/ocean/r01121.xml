  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Rosecrest Street and Marina Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Marina Way is a popular street which runs north and south.  South of here
the street runs past the entrance of the Oceancrest Central Arena, where
many fantastic battles have been fought for glory and the entertainment of
the populace.  On the northeast corner of the intersection is a strange
building which has a great gem atop it.  The gem radiates a purplish hue.
Rosecrest Street runs east and west here.  The City Wall is to the west.</LongDescription>
