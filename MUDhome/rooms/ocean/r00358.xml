  <ShortDescription>You are in a side room of the Red Dog Saloon, reserved only for officers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is quieter than the main public room outside, but the pirates
in here are just as drunk.  These men are older and meaner, and you
notice they stare quietly at you as you stand here.  Several barmaids
pass among them, and a couple of entertainers are taking a break.</LongDescription>
