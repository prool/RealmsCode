  <Name>Crypt Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a passage that seems to connect two paths together.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The crypt passage continues to creep along through the crypt.  There's
not a lot of activity here despite the large number of rats you've
seen lately.  The passage you are in is rather tight.  It doesn't look
like more than three people could fit in here.</LongDescription>
