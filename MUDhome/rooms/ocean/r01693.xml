  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, just north of the great City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vast City Walls have been the protectors of Oceancrest for as long
as anyone can remember.  On the north side of the road, you can see
the Farmer's Federation Building, where the farmers all gather to
discuss local politics and how it will adversly affect their well-being.
The farmer's lobby is one of the most powerful political units in 
Oceancrest and should not be taken lightly.</LongDescription>
