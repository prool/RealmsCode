  <ShortDescription>You are in a small, well concealed passage in the underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have heard stories of goblin treasure rooms down here, but of course
you cna't believe everything you hear.  And another thing - the stuff that
goblins think of as treasure is often pure junk.  Of course, now that you
are here, you probably ought to find out for yourself.</LongDescription>
