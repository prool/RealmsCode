  <ShortDescription>You stand on the edge of a bluff, overlooking a great valley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The city of Hafnia is not far above you, built on a rugged mountain plateau.
The elves were looking for an easy place to protect when they found these
peaks which rise above the city at either end.  To the north there is one
single peak which towers over all the others.  Atop it is a small castle.</LongDescription>
