  <ShortDescription>You are on the northwest route of Lake View Road, near Lake Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a beautiful valley spread out below you, with long, sloping
meadows and rolling hills on either side.  The scene is quite bucolic
and pleasant, making you wonder why you don't give up the adventurer's
life and find a place to settle down and raise a bunch of kids....
Nah, just a passing thought.</LongDescription>
