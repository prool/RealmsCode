  <ShortDescription>You are in a small shop, filled with the smell of fine leather goods.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>D'Tan's Armory fits all races and all sizes, but is limited to cloth and
leather armors.  Mages have trouble with the heavy metal armors because
they tend to interfere with their magical powers and thieves prefer 
leather because it makes them move much more quietly.  D'Tan realizes
these need and happily provides for them.</LongDescription>
