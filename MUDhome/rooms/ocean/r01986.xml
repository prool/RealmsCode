  <ShortDescription>You are in the swordsmith's shope in Evander's World of Weapons center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This large shop stocks all kinds of swords and weapons of all kind.  The
selection seems pretty good, but the weapons are not of that great of
quality.  However, if you just need a simple long sword because the one
you have broke, this is the place to go.  </LongDescription>
