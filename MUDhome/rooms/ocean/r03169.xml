  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The weather is still pretty calm, but it could change at any moment.  The
weather wizards in the city of Oceancrest like to practice their talents on
days like this.  Too bad the sky is so overcast, or you might be able to
determine which way to land by the position of the heavenly bodies.</LongDescription>
