  <ShortDescription>You are west of a gulley where a stream of water flows from north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the Lyanden Road was built only a few years ago, but there is another way
to travel between the eastern cities and Oceancrest.  Long ago, a caravan
trail was established, and it is still in use, but it lies far to the south.
The caravan trail is not considered safe for lone travelers.</LongDescription>
