  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, just north of the Rosecrest Street intersection.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Darby Reynold's shipbuilding offices are located east of Oceanview Drive.
For a considerable sum of money, just about any ship may be custom built
for the discriminating customer.  There is a loud, partying-type noise
coming from the building to the west.  It appears to be some sort of 
cantina, but there's no entrance on this side of the building.</LongDescription>
