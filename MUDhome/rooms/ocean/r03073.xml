  <Name>Temple Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the western side of the Temple.  You are in a secret passage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage is overrun with spiders and rats.  What do you suppose rats
find to eat in this terrible place?  On the floor there are also signs of
droppings by ettercaps.  The dung of an ettercap is quite singular and easy
to recognize.  It seems to consist of blackish-green pebbles in a pile.</LongDescription>
