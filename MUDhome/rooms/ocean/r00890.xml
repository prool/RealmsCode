  <ShortDescription>You are on a short path between the winery general store and farm housing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path meanders in an east-west direction, following a drainage
ditch filled with sewage.  The grape vines along the sewage ditch
appear to be particularily healthy and productive.  To the west is
a number of small shacks, lovingly called homes by the grape pickers
who live there.</LongDescription>
