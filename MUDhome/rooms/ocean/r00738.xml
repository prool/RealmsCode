  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Highland Avenue and Oceancrest Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceancrest Avenue runs west from the intersection with Highland Avenue,
which runs north and south.  On the east side of the intersection is the
eastern entrance to the city.  Leaving through the east will take you
into the plains beyond the city, a relatively dangerous place, roamed by
barbarian hordes and other bandits.  This path is the quickest way to
the mountains, but is also the most dangerous.  The cities of Brownhaven,
Hafnia and Kista lie to the east.</LongDescription>
