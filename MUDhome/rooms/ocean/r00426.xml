  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Bendine Way, west of the Oceancrest Hot Springs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The North Oceancrest Hot Springs and Spa provide countless people with
deluxe accomodations in small pools of flowing, natural mineral water, 
heated by the lava flow underneath the city.  Being so close to the
ocean puts Oceancrest on a bad fault line where quakes sometimes happen.
The upshot of this being the lava flow heats up the natural mineral water
beneath the city.</LongDescription>
