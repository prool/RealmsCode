  <ShortDescription>You are in Waterfront Plaza, a large shopping center near the south gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Waterfront Plaza boasts a number of specialty shops.  To the northeast
is Rudolph's Fighting Academy, where fighters of low to middle level
experience train.  To the northwest is the Adventures Unlimited shop
called Treasure Maps and Accessories.  Although they sell treasure maps
and other scrolls, it has not been determined if these are very useful.
To the southeast is Renee's Elven Leather Works for fine leather crafted
material, made the way elves like it.  To the south is the Tired Camel
Fine Imports shop where useful items may be traded.  Finally, on the
southwest is Michael's Repair Shop, where all weapons and armors may
be repaired for a modest fee.</LongDescription>
