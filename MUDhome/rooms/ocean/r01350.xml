  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Neilian Drive, south of the Dragon's Citadel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The powerful Dragon's Citadel is one of the few landmarks that have existed
before the City of Oceancrest was actually built.  On the south side of
the road is the Temple of Harmonic Discord, an odd sort of group of people
who try to solve problems without wars or other means of violence.  This
is, of course, impossible.</LongDescription>
