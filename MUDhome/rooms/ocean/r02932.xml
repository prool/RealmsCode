  <ShortDescription>You are on a rutted wagon road going east through the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road is a swampy looking area where trees stand
in water and moss hangs from their limbs.  The road is on high ground,
however, and appears to be climbing to the east.  The south side of the
road is overgrown with a thicket and large trees, and appears quite dark
and cold.</LongDescription>
