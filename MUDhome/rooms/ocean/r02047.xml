  <ShortDescription>You are in the main seating section of the Kista Amphitheater.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are excellent seats near the stage area, and vendors are selling hot
drinks and food on the side.  There are some very rich people attending, if
the quality of their dress is any indication.  You can hear an orchestra
tuning up, waiting for the oboe to give them an "A".</LongDescription>
