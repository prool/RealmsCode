  <ShortDescription>You are standing outside the cave of Xandaus, a strange old man.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hermits are always strange, and for some reason they always seem to have
long, flowing white hair and long beards.  The one who lives here is no
exception.  He is also very wise.  The outside of the cave is scattered
with small animal bones and other bits of refuse.  The skin of some
unknown animal is stretched on a frame which provides a sort of door
for the cave.</LongDescription>
