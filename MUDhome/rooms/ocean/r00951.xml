  <ShortDescription>You are on the main deck of the Widow Maker Pirate Ship.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Pirates are very civil when they are in a friendly port, but when at 
sea, they can be very dangerous.  Of course, most of the facade they put
on while in town is really just a farce.  They only come into town when
they require supplies or other necessities before going out onto the seas
again to attack other ships.</LongDescription>
