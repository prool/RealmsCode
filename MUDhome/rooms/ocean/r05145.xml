  <ShortDescription>You are near the top of a stone stairway, which has an awful odor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Old graffiti has been scratched into the stones, untouched now for several
hundred years.  Everywhere you have been in this ancient stone ediface has
been covered in soot and ashes, but the steps here look to be frequently
used.  It's impossible to see very far in either direction, as the steps
twist in a tight pattern going down.</LongDescription>
