  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, south of the Melbourne Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Melbourne Entertainment Arena provides citizens with the much needed
emotional releases of revenge against criminals and other dregs of 
society.  These people, accused and convicted of crimes, are thrown into
the pits to do battle with gladiators, and sometimes lions.  The 
spectators also get to join in by throwing rocks and other garbage at the
contestants.  On the south side of the road is D'Tan's Armory, where some
light armor may be purchased before entering the arena.</LongDescription>
