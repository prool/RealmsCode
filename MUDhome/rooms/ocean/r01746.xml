  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Wakeforest Drive and Monument Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The intersection of Wakeforest Drive and Monument Avenue is relatively
uneventful being at the easternmost point in town.  The large City Walls
on the east side of the road mark the boundaries of the vast city.  On
the southwest corner, you can see the Obidian Community Housing Complex
where most of the citizens who need to live inside Oceancrest live.  </LongDescription>
