  <ShortDescription>This is Brownhaven's northern bridge over the Baldywyne River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The river rushes by rapidly below your feet.  There must have been a good
deal of snow last winter.. The Baldywyne River has its headwaters high on
Mount Caledonia to the north.  Of course, its never been fully explored,
so that's just a guess since it flows from there.  No one has actually 
seen where it comes from.</LongDescription>
