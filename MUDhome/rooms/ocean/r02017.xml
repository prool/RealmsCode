  <Name>The Red Dragon Tavern</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The Red Dragon Tavern is perhaps the most popular place to visit in Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tavern is well kept by Kaliv and Crystal, who have claimed (while
under the influence) that they have single-handedly killed a red dragon
after it had burned off all their armor and melted their weapons.  They
claim to have used their last remaining magic spells to finally subdue
the dragon.</LongDescription>
