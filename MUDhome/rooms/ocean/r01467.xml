  <Name>Meat Freezer</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very cold freezer used to store meats.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It has long been known that meat must be kept cold or it would spoil.
Since the mages don't have dinner meetings every night, some meat needs
to be kept without it spoiling.  The mages use a number of tricks to
accomplish this using their magical powers, specifically through the
powerful iceblade spell.  Don't stay in here too long or you're liable
to get frostbite.</LongDescription>
