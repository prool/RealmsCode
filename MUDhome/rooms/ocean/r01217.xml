  <ShortDescription>You are wandering down Nagaritha Drive, north of the Klondike Wheat Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large wheat fields cover many acres of land on the southern side of
Nagaritha Drive.  The large plantation harvests more than enough wheat 
and grain to provide for the entire city, and exports the rest to make
some much needed capital for the farmers.  The Klondike Wheat Field is
always in need of unskilled labor to help with the harvesting and reduce
the number of pests infiltrating the wheat.  The entrance to the fields
is located off of Lankshire Parkway.</LongDescription>
