  <LongDescription>You are on a narrow road in a short valley which protect you from the wind.
the road climbs out of the valley to the east, and drops deeper into it
towards the west.  High mountains are all around you now, stark and cold in
the mountain air.  Being this high really takes your breath away.   A pall
of volcanic smoke hangs in the air.</LongDescription>
