  <ShortDescription>You are on the north side of a giant redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The huge redwood tree grows directly in the middle of the road.
The road splits to go around the biggest tree in this part of the woods.
North of here there is a footbridge over a small forest stream, and
a path almost as wide as this road.  There is a fence and a "no hunting"
sign along the west side of the road.</LongDescription>
