  <ShortDescription>You are in the ready room for champions.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is a healing room reserved for arena champions.  Anyone who comes in
here is a fighter who has won many battles on the arena floor.  A healing
mage stands by, ready to cast healing spells on any who needs them.  She
is impartial in whom she treats, and will treat everyone, but if you want
a spell cast on you, you must ask her for it.</LongDescription>
