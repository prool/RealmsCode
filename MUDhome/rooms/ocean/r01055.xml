  <ShortDescription>You are travelling on Eidenhoft Boulevard, just south of the Shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Shrine of Protectors, located north of Eidenhoft Boulevard, is more
of a monument to the gods.  Fighters leaving for battle often leave a
small sacrifice on the alters to appease the gods and to give them some
added strength.  The Shrine is not guided by a group of clerics or 
priests, but is upkept by those who pray and leave sacrifices there.
The intersection of Oceancrest Drive and Nagaritha Drive is southwest
of here.</LongDescription>
