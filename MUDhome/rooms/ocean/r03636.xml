  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of Castle Ragnar's main courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small alcove in the east wall leads to an apothecary shoppe.  Partially
blocking the way to the south is a bright red and white striped tent whose
entrance appears to be around to the south.  A great oaken tree grows here,
long ago having burst from the floor and put roots down through the stone
crevices.  A number of crows and ravens inhabit the upper limbs of the tree.</LongDescription>
