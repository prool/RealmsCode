  <LongDescription>The main kitchen is not only used to prepare meals, but is also the 
main wine storage area and meat freezer.  Cocktails, refreshments and
food are prepared for delivery to the main dining hall or to the
guests throughout the mansion.  The door to the west takes you back
into the main hall.  There is a freezer to the south that holds all
the meats so that they don't spoil.</LongDescription>
