  <ShortDescription>You are in a circular room used as a dining area in the Boar's Arse Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look about you, you realize that some foods are common to all races,
but on the other hand, there are some things that only an orc or gnome
would eat.  A large trestle table stands in the center of the room, loaded
with strange meats and foods.  looks like a buffet, so help yourself.</LongDescription>
