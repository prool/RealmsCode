  <Name>Oceancrest Memorial Fountain Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the west end of the circular path around the large fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The fountain is one of the first things most visitors to Oceancrest see
when they enter the town, if they travel along Main.  This larger-than-
life fountain is very inspiring to both young and old alike.  The 
circular path continues to the northeast and southeast.  The fountain
is to the east, where you can occasionally see young children playing
in.  Regalia Drive continues to the west.</LongDescription>
