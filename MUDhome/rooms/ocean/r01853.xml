  <ShortDescription>You have successfully defeated the Barbarian, and proven your worth 
as a Grunt, First Class.  Your barbarian brothers applaude your victory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you probably now know, barbarians don't let their kind advance without
making sure that they earn the title they are planning to advance to.  Now
that you have defeated the grunt, first class, you are now allowed to 
train to that class rank.  Unfortunately, as a grunt, first class, your
skills have exceeded the skills being taught at this section of the 
Barbarian Pits, and you must now search for the Tribesman Training Huts.</LongDescription>
