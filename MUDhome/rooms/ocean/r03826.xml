  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the Center Ring of the Carnival's main attraction.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Center Ring is the biggest of the three rings under the Big Top.
The Ringmaster announces the different attractions one after another
while trained elephants dance around him.  They come from a country far,
far away where people use them instead of horses.  Above you is the main
platform where skillful acrobats swing on trapezes and walk tighrtropes
In the adjoining rings tigers roar and clowns entertain.</LongDescription>
