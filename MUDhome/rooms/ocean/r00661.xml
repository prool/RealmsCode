  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Center Drive, just west of the Hofton Ziggurat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The impressive Hofton Ziggurat is based roughly on the Allakaren Pyramid,
found in the southeastern corner of the town.  Although it wasn't 
duplicated in the same size, the resemblance is fairly clear.  The
Ziggurat is used by many of the foreign policy makers to create stable
relations between the various city-states in the land.</LongDescription>
