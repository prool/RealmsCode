  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, taking in the country air.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The eastern section of town is fairly clean, with a lot of parks and other
non-tampered recreational facilities.  The fresh air is, of course, quite
refreshing, and a nice change from the industrialized sections of town
where the smell of alcohol is always in the air.</LongDescription>
