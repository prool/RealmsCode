  <Name>Red Ruby Hall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a hall composed completely of sparkling red rubies.  The rubies
reflect so much light that the entire corridor appears to be red.  The
passage continues to the north and south, both ends terminating in crystal
intersections.  To the east, there is a large room covered in gold plates.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You try to escape the brilliant red light of the ruby hall but without
much success.  Carefully examining the hallway, you find a short, cryptic 
message written on the floor near the west wall.  It says: "HELP."  As you
walk closer to it, the letters disappear into the redness of the hallway.</LongDescription>
