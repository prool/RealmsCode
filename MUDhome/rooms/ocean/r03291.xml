  <ShortDescription>These are the well kept west grounds of the Ogden Villa Estate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lush green grass is almost carpet-like in appearance, with every blade
trimmed to the exact same length.  South of you is a high wall surrounding
a garden.  A gate allows you a glimpse inside, and you see it radiates a
soft glow, hinting there is more to the garden than just nature.</LongDescription>
