  <Name>Overland Drive/Hillcrest Drive Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Overland Drive and Hillcrest Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hillcrest Drive has the reputation of forming the southern borders of both
the Necropolis and the Manor of Natasha de Allisk.  Of course this isn't
as bad as being the road going between the two deathly areas, as 
Overland Drive does.  Overland Drive runs northwest and south out of 
this intersection, while Hillcrest continues to the east and west.</LongDescription>
