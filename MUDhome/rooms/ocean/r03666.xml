  <Name>Old Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in an old tunnel where a great stone has fallen from the ceiling.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive stone blocks most of the way to the west, but with a bit of
effort you can probably squeeze by it.  The tunnel walls are moldy and
the air has a stink to it.  It doesn't look like anyone has been in this
part of the tunnel complex in many years.  Maybe even hundreds of years.
There are several closed doors in the tunnel further to the south.</LongDescription>
