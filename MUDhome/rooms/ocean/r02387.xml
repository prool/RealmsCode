  <Name>Cavern Cliff</Name>
  <ShortDescription>There is a cliff on the north side of the cavern overlooking the Abyss.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The apparently endless Abyss located to the north drops nearly endlessly
towards the center of the planet, but oddly, you hear some sounds of
movement and see occasional flickers of light from deep within the
chasm.  The cavern heads north across the cliff and east through a cave.</LongDescription>
