  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Neilian Drive, between two large forests.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On both sides of the road, you can see some thick forests that completely
obstruct your view inside them.  Not that there's anything to really see
if you could see past the trees.  The trees and brush tend to be so thick
that people seldom ever try to get into the forests.</LongDescription>
