  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lankshire Parkway, west of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Necropolis appears to continue on forever.  The large, metal
bars prevent you from entering the Necropolis from this side of the road.
The Main Entrance is located off of Netherworld Lane, to the north.  On
the west side of the road, you can see the Khelleva Estate and Mansion.
The large Estate is covered with gold and jewels, and is constantly 
guarded by a number of highly trained security guards.</LongDescription>
