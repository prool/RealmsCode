  <Name>The Widow Maker Main Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are near the center of the main deck of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At the center of the ship, you can see the masthead where you can try
to climb up to the crow's nest.  The crow's nest is the official look-
out for the captain and the crew.  However, since the ship is docked
in the port, it is unlikely that anyone is up there right now.</LongDescription>
