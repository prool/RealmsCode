  <ShortDescription>You are on the lowest of three levels, walking under a variety of trees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path to the northeast will take you to the second level of the Garden.
This walkway was the favorite of Queen Isaria, for whom the Hanging
Gardens were built, and some say her ghost can still be heard whispering
though the trees when the breeze is just right.  Have you noticed the
breeze has picked up?  Seems a little chilly, too.</LongDescription>
