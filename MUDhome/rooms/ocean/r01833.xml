  <Name>The Center Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the center path through the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are now just north of the Barbarian Chief's Hut, where all the major
planning and strategies are drawn up and torn apart.  Since they are just
barbarians, it's unlikely that any plan they have would make much sense
anyway.  The path weaves around the Trading Post, located to the west
along the Center path.</LongDescription>
