  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the Necropolis path, approaching the Walk of Heroes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path becomes a bit overgrown, as if it hasn't been cared for in
quite some time.  The mausoleum is still visible to the north, but
you shiver just looking at it.  To the southeast, the Walk of Heroes
comes into view, a place where the greatest heroes in Oceancrest's ancient
history are buried, each with monuments in their name.</LongDescription>
