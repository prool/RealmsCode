  <ShortDescription>Yo can no longer see your direction indicator.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the dragon turns his head and looks at you questioningly, but keeps flying.
Since you can no longer see the ground, it's hard to get your bearings.
It hasn't happened very often, but copper dragons have been known to crash
when they were flying blind.  Perhaps you should turn back, if you know
where back is.  You do, don't you?</LongDescription>
