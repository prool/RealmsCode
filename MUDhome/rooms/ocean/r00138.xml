  <ShortDescription>You are on Caledonia Road between the east village gate and Poor Alley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ramshackle houses are packed closely together on both sides of the road,
and people are hanging out windows, talking to each other.  A small church
is almost to the corner on the north side, but why is there an upside down
cross outside, and why is the head of a horned billy goat proudly on display
at the door?</LongDescription>
