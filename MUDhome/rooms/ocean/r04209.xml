  <ShortDescription>You are in the widest hallway of the Tower Castle, built by Prince Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a series of doors on the east side of the hall, some of which are
open.  They look like shops and stores.  This castle has a lot of people
living in it, and is almost a small city in its needs.  Merchants are quite
happy to meet that need, and have provided many services.</LongDescription>
