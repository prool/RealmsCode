  <ShortDescription>You have come to the intersection of Lelion Way and Marina Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The intersection lies just east of the Lelion Beach and Park, one of the
only beaches open to the public in Oceancrest.  Most of the beaches are
not accessible because of the City Walls surrounding the city.  Such is a
small price to pay for the security the City Walls provide.</LongDescription>
