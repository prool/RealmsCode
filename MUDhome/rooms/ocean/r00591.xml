  <LongDescription>The Sleepy Traveler Inn is a small residence for long-term visitors to
Oceancrest.  The accomodations are less comfortable than in the Evenborough
Inn, but made primarily for people who plan to stay for weeks or months
at a time.  On the west side of the road is the Evenborough Stables, where
visitors may leave their horses while visiting Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
