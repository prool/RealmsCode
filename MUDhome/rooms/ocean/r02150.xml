  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the mysterious Allisk Labyrinth.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Allisk Labyrinth was constructed many centuries ago by one Natasha
de Allisk, now rumored to be one of the most powerful vampires in the
lands.  Of course, no one reputable has seen her lately.  The Labyrinth
was created as an escape from reality, as Natasha was quite psychotic.
In her later years, the Labyrinth was used to lure victims to their
doom.  Lately, nothing has really surfaces about the Labyrinth and it's
probably just filled with some minotaurs and flying snakes.  The vampires
have long since abandoned this old tomb.</LongDescription>
