  <ShortDescription>You are in the gaming preparation lounge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The preparation lounge is used to prepare prisoners for their battle
with the wizards of Keslar.  The mages use prisoners as test dummies
to try out their new spells and other magical items.  Some of the
more powerful mages deal out instant death to many of the common people
off the street and can make the most powerful barbarians cringe.</LongDescription>
