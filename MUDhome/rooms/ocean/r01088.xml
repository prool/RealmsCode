  <ShortDescription>You are on a short road called Hafnia Way between Golden Dolphin Way on the
south, and Waterfront Way on the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A short way to the north, on the east side of Hania Way, is a large vacant
area that was once part of the DeNail corn field, but is now used by
merchants to assemble caravans to take supplies out of the city.  A camel
lot creates quite a smell.  There are a number of brightly colored tents
there, with banners snapping in the breeze.</LongDescription>
