  <ShortDescription>Wall Road West continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the west side of the road there is a burned building.  A sign says,
"Keep Out - Order of Brownhaven Militia."  No ordinary fire swept through
here.  You can see all the indications of a magical flame.  At one time
this was the home of Khallazar and Gharalara before they separated.  She
was a powerful cleric, dedicated to her deity, and he was a young alchemist.
What he saw in her, no one could tell.   She was considerably older than he.</LongDescription>
