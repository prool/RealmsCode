  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on the North Highway, near some huge boulders.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The highway runs almost directly north and south along here, and to the
north it looks like there is an entrance to some sort of outdoor inhabited
area.  If you want to go in there, you might have to climb over some of
these rocks and boulders.  They seem to block the highway, and any further
travel northward might be extremely difficult.</LongDescription>
