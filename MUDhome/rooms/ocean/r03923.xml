  <LongDescription>The walls are covered with sapphires, which cast an eerie blue light.
There is a single chair in the room, which hovers slightly off the floor.
Seated there is a wizard wearing a red robe with a blue collar.  He has a
tiny, glittering key to the training room in his hand.  He does not speak,
but points to the glittering key with his other hand.</LongDescription>
