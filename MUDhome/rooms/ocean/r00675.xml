  <ShortDescription>You are on Hofton Avenue between the City Walls and the Hofton Ziggurat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The impressive City Walls still dwarf the tall Hofton Ziggurat in size,
completely protecting it from bombardment from the outside.  The City
Walls provide security to the people of Oceancrest, which is why most
of the political conferences take place within the city.  No other city
in the lands provides as much protection.</LongDescription>
