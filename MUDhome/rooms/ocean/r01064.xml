  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just west of the Ministry of Truth building.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ministry of Truth is hardly what it appears to be, but the people in
it honestly believe that what they say is in fact true and that therefore
everyone else in the world must be lying.  Although the premise no doubt 
was originally good, the corrupt nature of the job managed to destroy their
integrity.  Nevertheless, many citizens believe them to be the wisest people
in Oceancrest.  Rosecrest Street continues parallel to the City Walls, 
running north and south.</LongDescription>
