  <ShortDescription>You are indeed fortunate to have made it this far.  Beware the guardians.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Walls of pitch black obsidian converge upon you.  Hallways depart from
the base of the stairs you are near, leading off to the north, south
east, and west.  The hallways are lined with glowing scpeters in place of
torches, which leave the air inside clean but stale.  It is light enough 
to see shadows on the walls, but you cannot see to what the shadows belong.
Eldritch was known for his kindness and benevolence in life, but you aren't
sure he would appreciate grave robbers in his tomb.  would you?</LongDescription>
