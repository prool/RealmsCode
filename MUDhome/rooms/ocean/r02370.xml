  <Name>The Great Glacier Ituk</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the massive glacier known to the natives as Ituk.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The glacier is surrounded by high mountains all around, preventing any
of the water from ever leaving this zone.  The massive block of ice
seems to stretch on for miles and miles in every direction.  Hopefully
you will have a ranger to help you track through this wasteland.</LongDescription>
