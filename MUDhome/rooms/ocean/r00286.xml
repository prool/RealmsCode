  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the outer path circling the northern mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's not really a mountain that you see, but it's the closest thing you
can think of that resembles what you're looking at.  The massive structure
juts out of the surface, seemingly out of nothingness.  The jagged edges
and sharp points make it relatively unclimbable.</LongDescription>
