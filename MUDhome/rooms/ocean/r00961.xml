  <Name>The Widow Maker Main Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on board the pirate ship Widow Maker, docked in the harbor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are towards the center of the large pirate ship.  The masthead is
located to the south.  Looking up, you can see the crow's nest high
above the deck, which acts as a lookout for the ship.  Since the ship
is docked, it is unlikely that anyone is in the crow's nest.</LongDescription>
