  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Leviathan Drive, taking in the majesty of the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road is a spectacular forest, like none you've
ever seen.  No one ever seems to go near it, as if it were haunted or
something.  On the west side of the road are the magnificent Avatar Ruins,
created by a wave of destruction by the Avatars.  Most of the destruction
has been cleaned up by the passage of time, and the development of the city,
but the monument stands as a warning for everyone to remember.</LongDescription>
