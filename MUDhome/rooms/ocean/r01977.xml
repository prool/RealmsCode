  <ShortDescription>You are in the Beginner's Circle in the Ivanhouse Sporting Complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ivanhouse Sporting Arena is designed for more one-on-one combat with
equally matched opponents.  The Beginner's Circle allows you, with up to
two of your comrades, to take on a human gladiator.  The gladiator is
tough, but you have a three-to-one advantage on him.  If this isn't
enough, you can always run away very quickly.</LongDescription>
