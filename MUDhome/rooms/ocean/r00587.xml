  <ShortDescription>You are on Leviathan Drive, between the Rodaisl Complex and the Shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Rodaisl Community Housing Complex is located on the east side of the
road, providing housing to thousands of Oceancrest citizens.  Individual
houses cannot be built inside the city due to the large population and the
confining City Walls.  The compromise was the construction of two Housing
Complexes to house the citizens of Oceancrest within the safety of the
City Walls.</LongDescription>
