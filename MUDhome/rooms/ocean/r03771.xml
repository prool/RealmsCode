  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern face of cliffs in the Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Below you is a narrow, sandy, sheltered beach area which is part of a wild-
life preserve.  Gulls and other seabirds wheel overhead, and there is one
very strange bird which is much bigger than the others.  The path continues
in a northwest-southeast direction as it runs along the face of the cliff.</LongDescription>
