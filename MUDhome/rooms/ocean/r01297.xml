  <Name>Mighty Tree Stump</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The path splits and seems to circle a great stump of a tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stump is perhaps two to three meters high, and is easily ten meters
in diameter.  The path seems to circle it, and one side of the tree
appears to be no better than the other in terms of getting around it.
Further to the west is the stream, and to the east is thick underbrush.</LongDescription>
