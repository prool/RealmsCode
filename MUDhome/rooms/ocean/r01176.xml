  <Name>Rosecrest Street/Netherworld Lane Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Rosecrest Street and Netherworld Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Netherworld Lane continues to the east and west.  About a block to the
east, you can start to see the outline of the Necropolis.  Rosecrest 
is a strangely shaped road, running north to south.  Taking Rosecrest
Street to the north brings you to the Ivanhouse Sporting Facility, a
moderatly interesting gaming center, similar to the Oceancrest Central
Arena, except geared more for one-on-one battle.  The games are not as
popular with the people, but just as interesting for the competitors.</LongDescription>
