  <ShortDescription>You are on the road which circumferences the town of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elves lay out beautiful cities, and Hafnia is no exception.  The road
you are on follows a geometrically perfect curve.  A short distance to the
north there seems to be an entrance to a combat field of some sort.  The
road splits to the west towards the western city gates.  Along the east
side of the road there are several shops, and what looks like a social
hall for some of the elven elite. </LongDescription>
