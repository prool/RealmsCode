  <Name>Open Grate</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are near an iron grate set in a old aquaduct.  Water flow is to the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The grate can be opened from this side without a key, but it looks like
it would require a key to come back in here.  The tunnel is dark in both
directions, but it cannot go east forever.  You must be getting close to
the eastern side of the island by now.  The temple is directly overhead.</LongDescription>
