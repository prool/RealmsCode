  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, south of the Recycling Center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road is the Oceancrest Trash Recycling Plant.  One
of the biggest problems in Oceancrest, as with all major cities, is the 
problem of trash.  As an incentive to keep the town clean, the city pays
one gold piece for each bit of junk anyone leaves in the Recycling center.
On the south side of the road is the Iron Works shop where small but sturdy
weapons may be purchased.</LongDescription>
