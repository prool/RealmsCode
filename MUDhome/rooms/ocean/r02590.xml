  <ShortDescription>You are at the base of a very old tower in the center of the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Kuroth Tower is not very tall, and at one time was designed to be the third
level of the Garden.  The tower is covered with flowering vines, hiding 
even the ancient door, which must be around here somewhere.  Unfortunately,
a demon has taken possession of the structure, and now resides inside.
There is a tale that the demon stole one of the three crystal masks
belonging to Elise, and dares her to come here for it.</LongDescription>
