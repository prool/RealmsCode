  <Name>The Sea Outside Nylandian Bay</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are drifting in sea swells of a vast body of saltwater.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a number of sea creatures feeding and swimming around you.
You also notice large quantities of Oceancrest garbage in the water as
well.  Far to the east you can still make out the port of Oceancrest and
the dreaded pirate ship widow Maker.  Perhaps you had better head back
to shore before you become lost at sea.</LongDescription>
