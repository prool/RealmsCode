  <ShortDescription>You are on a sandy beach road near the the Nylandian Bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not far to the south is the blue water of a natural deep bay.  The Nylandian
Bay is a very busy seaport, linking Oceancrest with the rest of the Land of
Mordor.  The Respitial Sea carries a great deal of the commerce between the
city and the rest of the continent, with merchant ships traveling up and
down the coast.  Of course, such riches as they carry means pirates are also
out there.  There is a rumor that pirates have sometimes used the grottos
and caves near here.</LongDescription>
