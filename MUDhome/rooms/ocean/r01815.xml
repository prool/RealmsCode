  <ShortDescription>You are in the Dentra Central Archery Range, in the Beginner Level area.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Numerous young elves and various other races often come here to work on
their archery skills.  Although they are not very good shots yet, they 
are tough and can be a challenge to beat in a contest.  It's funny to
see they young elves easily outscoring nearly every other race present
at the range.</LongDescription>
