  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A very ornate gate set in a tall, stone wall partially hides a mansion
on the north side of Plasnelt Road.  Just inside the gate there is a
pair of guards, each wearing a crimson coat and a high, fur hat.  They
stand stiffly, as if made of wood.  A flag snaps in the breeze just
above the guard station at the gate.  A general store is on the south
side of the road.</LongDescription>
