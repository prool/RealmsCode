  <Name>The Healing Hand</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a small building with a lot of white, healing lights.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A number of clerics and priests give their time to come to help people 
who have been severely injured.  They give their time freely because it 
is the way of their religion, and a helping hand is never really ever
forgotten.  You may rest here in peace without being disturbed until
you have been completely healed.</LongDescription>
