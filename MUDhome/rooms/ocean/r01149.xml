  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Regalia Drive, east of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The intersection with Rosecrest Street lies to the west, and the City
Walls are just beyond Rosecrest.  To the south is the Oceancrest Public
Amphitheatre and to the north is the Oceancrest Ministry of Truth.
Both places are usually pretty busy with activity, but usually for the
opposite reasons.  The Ministry houses numerous tome of various works 
which people enjoy studying, while the Amphitheatre is a venue to get
away from the hassles of everyday life.</LongDescription>
