  <ShortDescription>You are walking around the north side of Marina Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Marina Circle is an interesting monument to sailors and marines of all
ages and ranks.  The Marine Guards are fairly tough seafaring soldiers who
protect the City from the sea.  Many battles have been fought for control
of Nylandian Bay.  For Oceancrest, the Bay is an essential part of the
economy, providing much of the commercial and industrial activity in the
city.</LongDescription>
