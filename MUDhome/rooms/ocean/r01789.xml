  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, south of the Obidian Housing Complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Due to the lack of space within the City Walls, Oceancrest cannot support
the building of individual home within the limits of the city.  However,
since there is a need for people to live inside the city, large housing
complexes like the Obidian Community Housing Complex have been built.</LongDescription>
