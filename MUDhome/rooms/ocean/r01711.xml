  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Melbourne Avenue, west of a number of small shops.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Melbourne Avenue is one of the most popular streets in Oceancrest because
it runs past all the various shops and facilities located in the south-
eastern section of town.  On the east, you can see the Royal Jousting
Supplies shop where a number of polearms and other jousting weapons may 
be purchased for general use or training.  Since this is the poorer 
section of town, you can't expect much here to be of that great of quality.</LongDescription>
