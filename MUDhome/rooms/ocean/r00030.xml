  <ShortDescription>The road runs between the west wall and a group of servant's housing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The neighborhood is rather squalid and dirty, yet was once the pride of its
residents.  But no more.  These days the village is threatening to tear the
old buildings down, but eveyone knows they won't.  Too many more people
would become homeless, and the rich would miss their help.  A fence is on  
the east side of the road, and the village wall on the west.</LongDescription>
