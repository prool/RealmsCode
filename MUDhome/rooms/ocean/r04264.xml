  <ShortDescription>You are in a cluttered little shop managed by Thixel and Thortle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Everywhere you look are piles of goods and strange items which have been
left here to be redeemed later.  Thixel and Thortle, twin sons of Thoto,
don't really care about cleaning this place up, but they know exactly where
everything is.  They will give you about half of what something is actually
worth.  Are you sure you want to do business with them?</LongDescription>
