  <ShortDescription>You have entered a rather dusty room which hasn't seen daylight in years.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dust has settled rather uniformly across the entire room.  Just
by walking around, you are kicking up dust.  So much so, your vision
begins to look obscured.  You can see a large desk to the west with
a giant chair behind it.  The deskplate says "Mayor Millwood", but
you can't tell if there's anyone sitting behind the desk.</LongDescription>
