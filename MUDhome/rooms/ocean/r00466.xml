  <ShortDescription>You are on Darmanian Way, between the Temple of Clerical Science on the
south side of the road and Issac's Bard Cant on the north side of the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Issac's Bard Cant is a small place were bards can come to exchange 
various songs and incantations between others of their kind.  Unfortunately,
there is not a lot of bard activity in Oceancrest, and most of them stick
around this area of town in order to get some inspiration from the various
travelers who wander in and out around this area.</LongDescription>
