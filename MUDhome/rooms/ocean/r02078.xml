  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern tower stairwell which winds around the large tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This tower seems to be endless in in height.  At least the stairwell seems
to go forever.  Every time you take a step, either up or down, it seems as
though you have not moved at all.  The stairwell smells of mildew and wood
rot.  However, there is a wonderful smell of perfume coming from above.</LongDescription>
