  <ShortDescription>You are on the north side of the courtyard's reflecting pool.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A tall statue and several smaller ones are arranged in a fashion to tell
the story of how Rutger and Ragnar, twin sons of King Lyanden, have both
proclaimed themselves as the rightful successor to the crown.  Since no one
knows which of them was born first there is no way to settle the dispute
by law.  Many of the inhabitants of the land have taken sides, and there is
rumor of war soon.</LongDescription>
