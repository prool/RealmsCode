  <ShortDescription>You are in an arena draped with snow-white banners.  A White Knight awaits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have done well to reach your present level, but now you must once again
challenge the White Knight to show you are truly worthy of advancement.
The knight who awaits your move is at the level to which you aspire, and
he will do his best to defeat you, although he wishs you well.  You may
strike the first blow when you are ready.  The White Knight knows that
if God accepts you, you will defeat him.  He is ready.</LongDescription>
