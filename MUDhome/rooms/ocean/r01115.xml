  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Marina Way, which runs north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Marina Way is often considered a back road through some of the central
shops in town.  The reason being that almost all deliveries are made
from this side of the buildings.  The main entrances to most of the
buildings is off of Main Street, one block to the west.  To the west,
you can see a large, mysterious looking building which seems to 
radiate a blue-green smoke. </LongDescription>
