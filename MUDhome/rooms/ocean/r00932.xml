  <ShortDescription>Jacob has been fixing weapons and armor for over 200 years. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You breathe a sigh of relief as you walk into the repair shop.  
You didn't really want to travel all the way back to Brownhaven
to fix your broken equipment.  Hopefully the smithy won't break
your weapons as often.</LongDescription>
