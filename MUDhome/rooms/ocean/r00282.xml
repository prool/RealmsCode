  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the outer path of the impressive Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The outer path circles around the northern structure which you can see
to the south.  The strange mountain-like rock appears to just come out
of the ground, with no sign of any prior instability.  This, coupled
with the fact that magic has no effect here suggests that something might
be amiss.</LongDescription>
