  <ShortDescription>Two hallways join here.  One leads east, and the other runs north-south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The place is odd in a way that you do not notice at first.  Its a strange
feeling that is in the back of your mind, but keeps coming back to your
thoughts.  The completely bare walls make the halls look desolate and
ancient.  There's no dust, though, as if the halls were cleaned on a
daily basis.  Yet they have an old, dirty yellow look to them.</LongDescription>
