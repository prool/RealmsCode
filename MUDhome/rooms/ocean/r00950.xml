  <ShortDescription>You are on the boarding plankway leading to the Widow Maker's main deck.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dangerous pirates and their trusty sidekicks don't much care for
land lovers aboard their ship, and will probably make you walk the plank
for coming aboard their ship.  However, pirates are pretty stupid and
can probably be bribed to leave you alone.</LongDescription>
