  <ShortDescription>You are currently traveling along Eidenhoft Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly to the south, you see Leomund's Water Purification shop.  Of
course, all Leomund does is take the water from the river and boil it
to get rid of all the bacteria.  He does pretty good business because 
either people are too lazy to do it themselves or too stupid.  There
is a small building to the west with a sign that reads "Silk Dreams"
and a rather large bouncer guarding the door.</LongDescription>
