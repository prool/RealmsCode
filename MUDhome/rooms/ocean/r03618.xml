  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the main courtyard in Prince Ragnar's castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The broad stone floor is scrubbed clean by a cleaning crew, but there seems
to be a heavy stain of blood next to a hallway which disappears into the
depths of the castle.  Standing near the entry to the hall is a pushcart
and a wizened old woman.  She sells potions and oils, and mutters under
her breath as she gazes around the huge courtyard.</LongDescription>
