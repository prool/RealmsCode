  <ShortDescription>You are standing in a fountain with approximately one foot of water in it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Memorial Fountain was built to commemorate the victory 
over the orcs of Kandmanni nearly two centuries ago.  It stands as a
proud memorial to those who live in Oceancrest, and is generally 
considered to be the center of town, even though it's in the southwest
corner of Oceancrest.  There is a circular path around the fountain.</LongDescription>
