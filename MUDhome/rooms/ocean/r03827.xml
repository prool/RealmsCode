  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the outskirts of the leftmost ring of the Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are wise not to enter the ring because there are tigers walking over
there.  They might be dangerous if their trainer was not here.  In the
middle of the ring there is a large cage where there is a black panther.
Looking up, you notice the highwire, where the performers balance on their
way between platforms.  Be careful because some of the amateurs may fall
down on your head!</LongDescription>
