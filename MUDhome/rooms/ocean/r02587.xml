  <ShortDescription>You are in a field of wild foxglove, which is in full bloom.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>For a reason unknown to most people, the faerie folk are very fond of the
foxglove blossom.  This field must certainly be attractive to them, for 
the riotous color, if nothing else.  This is the second level of the
Hanging Gardens.  The first level is to the west, and a beautiful tower 
forms the third level to the east.</LongDescription>
