  <ShortDescription>The turbulent air comes off the foothills below.  65.n0.e0.s2.w2</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Further to the south the low foothills give way to the jagged Nartiz
Mountains.  The mountains are snow covered at their peaks, and cloud
cover lies in layers all the way to the jagged tops.  Looking west, there
is a pass that seems to get very narrow, between the northern Nartiz and
the southern face of Mount Aphinix.</LongDescription>
