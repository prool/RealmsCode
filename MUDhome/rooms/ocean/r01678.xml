  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, north of the Farmer's Federation Building.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As with most farmers in modern societies, the farmers must form a sort of
union where they can fight for their rights as a single entity instead
of just a number of whining peasants.  The Federation Building located to
the south provides a meeting place for such events.  The Klondike Wheat
Fields are located to the north of the road.</LongDescription>
