  <Name>Forest Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a smooth tunnel deep under the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walls are like glass, as though intense heat was used to fuse the earth
into a bore sighted tunnel.  It runs straight as an arrow from northwest
to southeast.  Although its not enough light to see by, the walls glow with
an eerie greenish luminescense.</LongDescription>
