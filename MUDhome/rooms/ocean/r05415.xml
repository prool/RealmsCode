  <Name>Foothills Trail/Garden Path Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the Foothills Trail east of the community of Nyyron.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Enchanted Forest is on the west side of the trail, and steep foothills
are on the east.  There are some strange looking plants and vines on the
west side which seem to creep and move even as you watch.  Looks like there
is a small path cutting over to the west, through that wild vegetation.</LongDescription>
