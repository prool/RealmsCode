  <Name>Cave in the Nellan Mountain Range</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very desolate cave apparently in the middle of nowhere.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's cold.  Very cold here.  The cave shelters you somewhat from the
snowy weather outside, but the air is still very frigid.  There is a small
circle on the floor that appears to glow with a bright golden yellow
hue.  The rest of the cave is quite desolate.</LongDescription>
