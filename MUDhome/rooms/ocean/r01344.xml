  <ShortDescription>You are in the brig of the pirate ship Widowmaker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Pirates don't really believe in brigs, preferring instead to simply
toss overboard anyone who misbehaves on their ship.  Several years ago,
a small hobbitish pirate got drunk, and accidently was locked in here.
The other pirates tried to get him out, but when they coldn't find the
key they left him in here.  Since he was in against his will, they called
it the brig.  Some say the chief bosun knew where the key was all the time
and simply hid it as a joke.  Some joke.</LongDescription>
