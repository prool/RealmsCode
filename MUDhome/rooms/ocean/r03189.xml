  <ShortDescription>You are swimming in the Respitial Sea below tall sea cliffs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cliffs are craggy and look to be impossible to scale.  High on the
rock face you can see the nests of sea eagles, perhaps the only creatures
who will ever inhabit those dark places.  The Land of Mordor is a strange
place indeed.</LongDescription>
