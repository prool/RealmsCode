  <ShortDescription>You are on Tranquility Way, , west of the Brunskid Trader's Guild.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is an old-growth forest to the north which the city fathers have left
completely undisturbed.  At one time a land developer tried to go in there,
thinking he would make a lot of money, but nobody ever saw him again.  The
forest on the south side seems to be a little younger then the north side,
but its still quite mature.</LongDescription>
