  <ShortDescription>You are in the recycling center for the southeastern section of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In order to keep the city clean, the city has managed to finance a recycling
option to the citizens of the city.  For each item you bring in to be 
recycled, you will get five gold pieces.  Hopefully this incentive will keep
the streets clean and save the city even more tax dollars to clean up the
streets themselves.</LongDescription>
