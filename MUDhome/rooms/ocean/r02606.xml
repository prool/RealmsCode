  <ShortDescription>This is a short dog-leg in Kuroth's Tunnel, beneath the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The slime on the walls is almost alive, and makes the going very slippery.
The demon Kuroth built this tunnel as an escape from his tower, in case
he was ever attacked by Elise, whom he dared to come after him after he
had stolen her crystal mask.</LongDescription>
