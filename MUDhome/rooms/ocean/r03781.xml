  <ShortDescription>You are on the shore of the Lithium Inlet, in the Lelion wildlife preserve.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Actually, this is a gravel beach leading down to the water's edge, rather
than sand.  It's also one of the few places where you can easily get to
the water, as most of the way along the Lithium Inlet the banks are pretty
high.  To the west you can see a walkway which follows the bank but is
obscured by giant cypress trees which grow down to the water line.  The
path continues to the east.</LongDescription>
