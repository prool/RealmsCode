  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, which continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Being that Main Street is one of the major roads in Oceancrest, it would
not be unnatural not to see a few inns and taverns along the way.  To the
west is the Dragon Tooth Inn, a very popular and rather expensive Inn 
for the very exclusive upper class.  The entrance to the Inn is off
of Hillcrest Drive, to the south.  There is also a large building on the
east side of the road which seems to radiate a lot of magical energy.</LongDescription>
