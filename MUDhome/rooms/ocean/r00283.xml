  <ShortDescription>You are walking around the northern side of the Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Occassionally, you can see small animals flying about in the Ruins, but
seldom do they seem to attack you.  They appear to just be watching your
progress from a distance.  At times, they may come close enough to 
examine you, but it's hard to make out just what they are.</LongDescription>
