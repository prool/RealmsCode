  <ShortDescription>You are in a gypsy camp located in a broad clearing in a grove of trees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large campfire burns brightly in the center of the camp, and a group
of dancers swirl to the music from a wild violin played by a tall youth
wearing bright clothing.  A brown bear in a harness shuffles with them,
waving his giant paws in time to the music.  The good smells from the
cooking pots are making you hungry.  Several large wagons are pulled into
a circle around the clearing to the north, while there appears to be an
animal keep to the west.  Easterly is a smooth, worn path leading away
from the camp.</LongDescription>
