  <ShortDescription>You are on the path taking you around the forests of Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have entered an area that appears to be reserved for gardening.  
The druids survive solely on the food that they grow in their gardens,
which appears to be quite large.  There is a small orchard to the 
southeast where a number of large fruit trees are growing.</LongDescription>
