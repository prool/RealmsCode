  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the famous Hanging Gardens, on Arboretum Way. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Actually, this is really just a very wide path through the trees, but it
is well maintained and you find it quite clean.  There are a number of owls 
overhead, and strangely, you can understand their conversation.  They invite
you to join them, if you can fly.  To the east you can see the second level.</LongDescription>
