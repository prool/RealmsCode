  <ShortDescription>This is the Leviathan Dock, where occasionally large ships will dock.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking out into the Nylandian Bay, you see several small vessels either
making their way into the bay, or out into the treacherous Respitial Sea.
While Pirates are fairly calm when on shore leave, they can get pretty
aggressive when out of the bay, looking for prey.  This dock is the home
of the pirate ship Widow Maker, and occasionally it sets sail unexpectedly
with some of the citizens of Oceancrest still aboard.  The swashbucklers
aboard turn ugly when that happens, and become aggressive.</LongDescription>
