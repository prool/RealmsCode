  <ShortDescription>You are in the sleezy, run-down Silent Knife Assassin's Guild.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This rustic location, pretty much falling apart everywhere you look, is
one of the major Assassin's Guilds in Oceancrest.  Luckily, it is not a
very popular one, and its current use now is primarily for training low
level Assassins in the art of cuthroat killing without the victim knowing
what hit them.  Only Minor Assassins may enter the training room to the 
south.</LongDescription>
