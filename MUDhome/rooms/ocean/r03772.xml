  <Name>Wildlife Preserve Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a path along the southern side of the Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path drops steeply to the northeast, and rises gradually to the west,
forming a tranquil and quite place to overlook a wildlife preserve on the
north side of the Lelion Beach and Park.  Great birds of some type you have
never seen anywhere else float in the sky above, occasionly diving into
the water to the north.  Across the Lithium Inlet you can see several shops
and a pub which you know is the Might and Muscle Tavern.</LongDescription>
