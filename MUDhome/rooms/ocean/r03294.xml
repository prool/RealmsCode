  <ShortDescription>You are in a quiet temple which is dedicated to the impossible goal of peace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>However, just because peace is impossible does not mean it should not be 
sought.  Many legendary fighters and young knights have been in this small
temple seeking guidance in how best to achieve the impossible.  The Jinsuti 
Master who resides here will help you in your training.  He believes that
peace is achieved when you have the ability to defend yourself with the
advanced fighting techniques he advocates.</LongDescription>
