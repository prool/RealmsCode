  <ShortDescription>You are proceeding down Riverdell Way, west of the Iilandi University.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Iilandi University covers nearly three city blocks, starting at the
Allakaren Circle and heading north from there.  The University houses the
city's finest creators and thinkers.  Citizens may take classes here for
their own self-enrichment or to work towards degrees in various fields 
of study.  The Facility is rather modernistic for its time, but runs into
a number of budget problems as it expands.</LongDescription>
