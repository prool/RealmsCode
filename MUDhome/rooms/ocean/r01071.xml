  <LongDescription>Nagaritha Drive runs east from Rosecrest Street, and continues east to the
City Wall.  It is one of the longest roads in Oceancrest.  Rosecrest Street
is perhaps the longest street, though.  It runs from the most southern part
of the city to the north City Wall.  It changes direction several times.</LongDescription>
