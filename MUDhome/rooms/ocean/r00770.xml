  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, north of the Iilandi University.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Iilandi University is one of the most prestigious schools in all the
realms, mostly because it not only lets anyone who has a desire to learn
enroll, but also because the professors must have a genuine desire to
teach and do research.  The various scientific stations around the 
University provide an infinite amount of researchable activity that could
keep the great minds of the time busy for generations to come.</LongDescription>
