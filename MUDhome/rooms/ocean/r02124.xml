  <ShortDescription>You are in a larger hallway that continues to the east.  There is an
exhibit here on the wonders of the forest and the magic that inhabits it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large hall is filled with trees and shrubs which delicately cover the
grey walls of the Museum.  There are a number of exhibits here showing
scenes from the Enchanted Forest.  The area has tree sprites and dryads
and other magical, mystical creatures who may be found in the Enchanted
Forest.  Of course, if you would like to see them in their natural setting,
you should consider an adventureous trip to the forest.</LongDescription>
