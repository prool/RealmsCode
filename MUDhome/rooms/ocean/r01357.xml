  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Neilian Drive, north of the Snake Eyes Gaming Facility.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Gambling has never really been illegal in Oceancrest, but highly discouraged.
Not so much because of the gambling itself, but what the loss of large
amounts of money does to people.  After all, the house always has an 
advantage, otherwise they wouldn't be doing it.</LongDescription>
