  <Name>Massive Gate</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are near the great gate of Castle Ragnar, standing at the drawbridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Traffic during the daytime is very heavy, but the gate is closed at night. 
The palace guard is in good numbers here, and they inspect carts and
vendors waiting at the gate.  Some of the stranger looking travelers are
stopped and asked their business.  As you look about you, you see a door
to the side that seems to lead to the guard headquarters.  Through the
massive arch you see the immense courtyard of the castle, and looking
north there is a well traveled road leading away from the castle.</LongDescription>
