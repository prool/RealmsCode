  <ShortDescription>You are in Ennia's Shop of wonderfully curious poisonous animals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Poisions and venoms have always been somewhat of a curiosity, and Ennia
has made her life dealing with such things.  Of course, since she 
deals so much with the venomous and poisonous pets, she always has
antedotes and other remedies ready at a moment's notice.  There is a
small exhibit to the west with various exotic animals.</LongDescription>
