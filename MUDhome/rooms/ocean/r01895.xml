  <ShortDescription>You are in the Cast Iron Shields shop in Leonardo's Foundry.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Shields are essential to any warrior's equipment lists, and only the
finest iron and metal shields are sold here.  All shields are pretty
generic, but as is usually the case, the larger the shield, the more
protection it give you.  A good shield complements all the other armor
you are wearing.</LongDescription>
