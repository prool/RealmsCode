  <Name>Mud Island</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have reached a muddy island in the dark swamps of the enchanted forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mud at your feet is slippery and seems to move as you slog through it.
Bubbles of gas rise in the mud and go "plop", leaving a terrible odor in
the air.  Large slabs of mud seem to slide away from you as move, while
other slabs of mud appear to be about to rear up and block your path.
Water spiders and snakes are the only form of life you can see, and you
have heard stories of the spiders getting as large as a man.</LongDescription>
