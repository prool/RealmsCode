  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way between to small shopping centers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are two shopping centers on both the north and south sides of the
road.  On the south side of the road is a large building with three shops
in it.  Directly to the south is a door entrance to "Richard's Rare 
Herbs".  A distinct yet unknown odor seems to radiate from the shop.
On the north side of the road is a sign which reads "Leomund's Water
Purification" next to a rounded door.  Water purification is a useful
idea, but can more easily be accomplished by boiling the water.  But as
they say, there's a sucker born every minute.</LongDescription>
