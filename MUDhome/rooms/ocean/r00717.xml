  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, south of a Paladin's Order.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Holy Order of the Black Cross is located on the north side of the 
road, opposite the Holy Order of Corellon Larethian on the south side of
the street.  Luckily, there is not much hostility between humans and elves
so they can practice their own religions and beliefs without annoying
the other race.</LongDescription>
