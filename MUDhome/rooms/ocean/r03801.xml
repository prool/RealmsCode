  <LongDescription>To the west lies the bustling midway.  There are many sights to see and
crowds of people waiting for their turn to see them.  The midway is home
to bizarre and exciting sideshows, and features wierd and unusual life forms
and strange artifacts.  You can hear the roar and screech of animals to
the west.  A large banner tells you that a Puppet Show is to the south.</LongDescription>
