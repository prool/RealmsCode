  <ShortDescription>You are in the foyer outside the Bendine Aquarium at the entrance to the 
large Marina, home to the salt-water exhibit and the giant whale tanks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Aquarium is located to the west.  On the north side of the entranceway
is the gigantic whale tank where various species of whales are kept to
amuse children and adults alike.  To the east is the Salt Water Exhibit
in the Rhinestone Marina itself.  The Bendine Bay is cut off from the
Marina by a large, iron gate, preventing the animals in the bay from
escaping and keeping the carniverous creatures of the marina out.</LongDescription>
