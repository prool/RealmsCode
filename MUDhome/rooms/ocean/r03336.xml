  <ShortDescription>The wide gravel path of white rock passes in front of the Sage's Rest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The granite and pink marble, gridded with silver and gold, has an entrance
where there is a staircase descending into darkness.  Although it looks
like an expensive tomb, there is something about its appearance that pulls
at your curosity.  Something about it seems out of place, almost turned
around.  Whatever it is, it's very disturbing.  The entrance is north.</LongDescription>
