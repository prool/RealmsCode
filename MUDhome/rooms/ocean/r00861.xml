  <ShortDescription>You are in a dimly-lit green shaded hallway that appears to head down
a corridor to the south.  To the north is an iron gate that appears to
be locked.  The stench of rotting flesh is prevalent beyond the gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lime-green walls are surprisingly slick and clean.  A strange mist
appears to the south that obstructs your view of exactly where you're
going or where the hallway leads.  </LongDescription>
