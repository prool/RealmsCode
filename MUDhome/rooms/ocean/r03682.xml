  <Name>Tower Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a narrow tunnel, not quite tall enough for you to stand up.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At times, when the tunnel twists, you can barely make it around the turn.
The tunnel seems to have a steep slant to it, going up in the southeast
direction and down into blackness towards the northwest.</LongDescription>
