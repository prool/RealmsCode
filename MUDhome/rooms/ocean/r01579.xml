  <ShortDescription>You have stumbled into a large patch of briar bushes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is by far not one of the best places to visit.  There are many 
thorny briar bushes everywhere and they seem to be cutting you up.  The
forest to the east blocks any plans you might have about leaving Etolos
from any direction other than the way you came in.</LongDescription>
