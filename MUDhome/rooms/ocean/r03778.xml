  <ShortDescription>You are in a dense woods of cypress trees in the wildlife preserve.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walkway skirts along the bank of the Lithium Inlet on the north side
and the woods on the south.  There are several paths going south, deeper
into the woods, but the walkway is much wider and more comfortable.  Above
the tree tops to the south you see a cliff face, so the woods cannot be
too deep in that direction.  Across the water you can see several of the
nicer stores in Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
