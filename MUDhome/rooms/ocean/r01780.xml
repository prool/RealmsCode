  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, north of the Obidian Housing Complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Citizens of Oceancrest who wish to live in the city itself must live in
the community residences provided for by the city as there is not enough
empty space inside the City Walls for everyone to build a house.  However,
spacing is not really limited, and anyone who wants to live in the city,
both for protection and convinience, may do so by applying at the Obidian
Community Housing Complex or the Rodaisl Complex, located more towards
the center of town off of Leviathan Way.</LongDescription>
