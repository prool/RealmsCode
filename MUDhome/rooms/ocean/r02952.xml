  <Name>Hera's Outer Garden</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the outer garden of Queen Hera, descendent of the original queen.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees here are all fruit bearing trees, and it is evident that a
great deal of planning went into their selection, as several of the trees
are always in bloom, regardless of the time of year.  The thicket you see
is heavy with berries, and sweet smelling honeysuckle climbs on an almost
hidden stone wall.  There is an opening in the wall leading to the inner
garden.  Rumor says that a Sleepless Dragon guards the inner garden.</LongDescription>
