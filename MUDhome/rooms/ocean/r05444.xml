  <ShortDescription>You are on a steep, winding road in the Taseletek Mountain Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This road follows a natural trail between Mount Tasletek on the north,
and Mount Aphinix on the south.  The mountains to the south were formed by
active volcanos, and are the homes of horrible mountain trolls.  Peaceful, 
but dumb giants live on the slopes of the Tasletek.</LongDescription>
