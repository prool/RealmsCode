  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the northern edge of Khelleva Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Eidenhoft Boulevard continues to the north from Khelleva Circle.  The
Circle itself continues to the southeast and southwest. On the western
side of the road, you can see a strange building with a large gem hovering
about it.  When the sunlight hits the gem, it radiates a vigorous purple
hue over the building and its adjacent roads.</LongDescription>
