  <ShortDescription>You are on Nissiau Lane, between Icthor's Repair Shop and Victory Travels.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Icthor's Repair Shop is located on the north side of the road and repairs
most weapons and armor that have worn out due to extensive wear.  No 
guarentee is made, however, on the items because some might be beyond
repair.  On the south side of the road is Victory Travels, a small travel
broker that can tell you where other cities are and how to get to them
via boat or ship.</LongDescription>
