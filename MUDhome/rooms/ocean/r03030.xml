  <ShortDescription>This section of the passage leads to the eastern section of the shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>No light can be seen anywhere in the passage, but the sound of the chanting
from the goblin church echos off the cold stone walls.  Most of the passage
is easy to walk in, but this particular section seems to only tall enough
for you to stand if you stoop slightly.  If you are not careful, you might
bang your head on the ceiling.  Your armor and weapons seem to make a lot
of noise down here as you walk.</LongDescription>
