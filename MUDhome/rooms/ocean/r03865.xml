  <ShortDescription>You are standing in a slightly cleared area in the jungle of Uland Island.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking to the east through the heavy brush, you can barely make out a
ruined temple, long abandoned and forgotten.  It looks like it was built
in the form of a truncated pyramid, but several large stones, which must
weigh tons, are in a jumble near the entrance.  Looks like an earthquake
might have shattered the ediface, as the entrance is caved in.</LongDescription>
