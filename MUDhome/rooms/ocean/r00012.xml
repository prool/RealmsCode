  <ShortDescription>You are on Goldenrod Avenue which runs east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The village wall is a uniform dirty brown on the north side of the road.
The appearance of the wall is how the village of Brownhaven got its name.
This narrow little road might better be called an alley along here.  It
seems to twist and turn every few meters as it winds along behind the back
doors of a number of shops.  A faded old sign above one of the doors says
the place was established about four hundred years ago by a dwarf named
Ahabanabanazzer.</LongDescription>
