  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the Castle Ragnar's open-air courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A stone soffet overhangs the courtyard here, providing relief from both
the sun and rain.  You see three doors set in the marble wall, each a
different color.  There is nothing here to identify their purpose.  To
the east is the troop assembly floor, and further south is a couple of
tents where you can hear the vendors hawking their wares.  A narrow 
opening in the wall appears to make a right angle after a few meters 
inside the wall.  If you go in there, you will have to squeeze to get in.</LongDescription>
