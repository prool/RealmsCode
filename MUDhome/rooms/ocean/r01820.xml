  <Name>The Barbarian's Trading Post</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a small pit where a number of goods may be purchased.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It is very rare that barbarians have money, but occasionally, they will
require new or more improved stuff.  So when they do come into some
unforseen wealth, they will come here to purchase just about anything
they need.  The Post also sells a number of trinkets and other useful
junk that might have some use outside the Barbarian Pits.</LongDescription>
