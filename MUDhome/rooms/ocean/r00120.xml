  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Goldenrod Avenue and East Ulandia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Goldenrod Avenue is to the east.  Directly west is the banks of the
Baldywyne, a fast moving river which flows from the mysterious heights
of Mount Caledonia.  There is a boat rental for those interested in 
seeing the river first-hand.  A small sword shoppe, with glittering
blades on display, is next door.</LongDescription>
