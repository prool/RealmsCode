  <Name>Jungle Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a damp and overgrown trail leading through the lush jungle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This trail is evidently not used vey much, because it almost doesn't
exist.  The brush from either side has invaded the path and its difficult
to be sure you are on it for long stretches.  Over to the south you can
hear the sound of water falling and splashing into a pool, but you can't
see it.  A bird screams directly overhead, sounding exactly like a human
in extreme pain.</LongDescription>
