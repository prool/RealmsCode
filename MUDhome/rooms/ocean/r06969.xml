  <ShortDescription>This is where Darwin comes to have some peace and quiet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In addition, the plush surroundings provide a nice place to entertain
guests.  The room is dimly lit by a gas lantern hanging from the
ceiling, and several tables surround a roll-top desk at the northern
wall.  On the desk can be seen several large stacks of papers that
appear to be notes on the various species that inhabit Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
