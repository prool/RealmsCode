  <ShortDescription>You are on top of rocky cliffs extending westward in Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cliffs on either side run down to the beach areas to the south and
the Lithium Inlet on the north.  The flat part of the cliff extends
to the west and east.  You are much higher than the fog, but the bay is
shrouded in a dense blanket of grey to the southwest.  The clifftops 
provide a nice view of the ships in the bay, and the city to the east.</LongDescription>
