  <LongDescription>Food storage is a very important part of today's society, as who knows
when a famine can strike.  However, most perishable goods don't last for
more than a couple of days.  When you by some meat, you usually have to
buy the whole cow, and a whole cow can last a family for months.  Therefore,
the quick solution may be found at Iila's, who specializes in long-term
food storage.  </LongDescription>
