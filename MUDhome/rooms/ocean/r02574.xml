  <ShortDescription>You are on a high-arched bridge, directly above a reflecting pool.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north you can see the wall around the Hanging Gardens, and to
the south you see a very restful spot with comfortable benches.  Below
you is a quiet pool, almost like a mirror in appearance.  A face looks
back at you, but it's not your face!</LongDescription>
