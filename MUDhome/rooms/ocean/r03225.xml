  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Mulberry road, which goes between Kista and Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The side of the road is lined with Great Mulberry trees, which are old
trees that turn the road into a wonderful panarama of vivid colors in
the autumn when the leaves turn and fall to the ground.  This walk is
well patrolled and is considered a very safe road.  Young lovers often
stroll here in the moonlight.</LongDescription>
