  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, west of the Fairy Dust Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Fairy Dust Inn is a popular inn for people coming into the city from
the ocean.  The other inns are well to the north and south, near their
respective entrances to the city via land.  The Fairy Dust provides a good
nights sleep for a good rate, though.  On the west, you can see the Shrine
of Poseidon, and a number of sailors entering and leaving the shrine.</LongDescription>
