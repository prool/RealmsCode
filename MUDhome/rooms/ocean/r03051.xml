  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark passage, which leads to the western side of the shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Smoky torches are high on the ceiling, giving scant light.  They seem to
have burned out entirely up ahead in the direction you are traveling.
The passageway is dry and quiet as you move through it, almost eerie in
its silence.  A great wooden door with a single, massive symbol carved
on it is over to the west.</LongDescription>
