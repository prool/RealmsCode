  <ShortDescription>You are in a desolate secret hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have wandered into a secret hallway behind the torture chamber.  You
can hear the tortured screams of victims being eternally punished.  The
door appears to be bolted from the inside.  Something just doesn't seem
right, though, although you can't really tell why.</LongDescription>
