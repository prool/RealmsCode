  <ShortDescription>You are in a low and narrow part of a collapsed hall, in Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A gentle rush of air comes from the broken wall, and you can see the hellish
acid filled moat outside.  There is no apparent way across it, as the draw-
bridge was burned during the battle.  The acid makes your eyes water and
your throat burn.  This is not a pleasant place.</LongDescription>
