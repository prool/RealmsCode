  <ShortDescription>You assume you are somewhere under the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The smell is getting worse.  You see a light in the passage to the
northwest.  As you try to turn your attention away from the stench
of decaying bodies, you notice some ritualistic paintings and carvings
on the wall.  It appears to be a sacrifice of a young virgin elf to
some evil looking gods.</LongDescription>
