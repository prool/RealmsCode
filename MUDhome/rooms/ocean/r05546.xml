  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern path of Glabor Gulley, near a large cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are several smaller caves to the east and the west, but this one 
appears to be a community cave rather than one of the residences.  Trolls
have been known to enjoy a drink or two, so perhaps this is a gathering
place for those desiring some of the good Uland rum made by the dwarves.</LongDescription>
