  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hafnia Way, just west of the Caravan camp. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large shopping complex to the west called Waterfron Plaza.  The
plaza boasts an elven leather shop, a repair shop, and various other shops
featuring imports from around the world.  Directly to the east is a large
field that belongs to the DeNail family, but has often been used as a
camp for the assembly of caravans to leave the city.  The shops are usually
the first to buy the goods arriving from far off places.   There is also a
fighting academy in the Waterfront Plaza to the west.</LongDescription>
