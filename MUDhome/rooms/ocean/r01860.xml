  <Name>Penelope's Toy Store</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a large shop full of antique toys on dusty shelves.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Penelope doesn't really like to sell toys, but prefers to buy them.
She makes her living selling musical instruments in the next room of
the store, but likes to display her collection of toys in here.  Most
of the toys were hand made by master craftsmen and there are signs
asking you to please not handle the merchandise.</LongDescription>
