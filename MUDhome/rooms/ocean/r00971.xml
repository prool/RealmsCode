  <Name>The Widow Maker - Below Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the Widow Maker pirate ship, below the main deck of the ship.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ahead to the north is the galley.  You can smell the cook stiring up
something delicious for dinner, but the continuous rocking of the ship
under the main deck prevents you from enjoying that sensation.  The 
hallway you are in continues to the south from here, past most of the
crew cabins.</LongDescription>
