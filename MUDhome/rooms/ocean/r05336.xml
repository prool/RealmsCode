  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on a well maintained and patroled road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Lyanden Road follows a definite line between the forest and the desert.
Normally, one might expect a gradual change between a forested area and
sun-baked desert with nothing growing on it except sand dunes, but that
doesn't seem to be the case with the K'tral Desert and the Enchanted Forest.</LongDescription>
