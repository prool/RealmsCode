  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Nagaritha Drive, north of the Butcher Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Circle-Bar Farm Fresh Prime Meats shop is located on the south corner
of the road, where all the fresh meat is sold to consumers.  The butcher
shop is ideally located around the various ice and preservative shops so
that the meat can be kept relatively edible for long periods of time 
without having to worry about bacteria or other nasty diseases.</LongDescription>
