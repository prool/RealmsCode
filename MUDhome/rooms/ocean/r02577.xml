  <ShortDescription>This is the third station of Veratus, the Oracle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Candles and burning incense are set into niches in the wall, and a small
fountain of water cascades down the tile wall on the other side.  If you
have reached this place and Veratus is still here, in the form of an owl,
then you have gained her interest in your quest.  Once you enter her
chambers, you will see her in her true form.</LongDescription>
