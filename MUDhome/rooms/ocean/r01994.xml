  <ShortDescription>You are on a narrow path located on the west side of the Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you walk along the path, you can see the impressive Mausoleum located
towards the northeast.  The path apparently circles around it and then
eventually goes to the front entrance if you follow it to the north.  If
you go east you will come to the Werewolves Den south of the Manor.</LongDescription>
