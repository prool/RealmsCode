  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Wakeforest Drive, west of the Tranquility Patrol.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Tranquility Patrol Station is located on the east side of the road
and provides assistance in keeping the peace in Oceancrest.  These domestic
guards patrol the streets of Oceancrest, cleaning up crime where ever they
can.  Unfortunately, the Tranquility Patrol is rather small and cannot
handle much of the action which can take place in a city as large as
Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
