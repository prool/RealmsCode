  <LongDescription>The barbarians are not much for names, let alone intelligent dialogue.
Therefore, not much around here is named except for the most vital
areas.  The barbarians don't really have a need for much of the fancy
directions everyone uses in town, and just resort to pointing and 
grunting to get their point across.</LongDescription>
