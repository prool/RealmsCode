  <ShortDescription>You are in the primary access hall for the guards and servants.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the entrance to the servant and guard hallway.  It is 
restricted to authorized servants and guards, but there doesn't seem
to be anyone around to stop you.  Since the hall is in plain sight,
you don't see any harm in a little exploration.</LongDescription>
