  <ShortDescription>This is the north end of Boran Street, near the village wall. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a gate across the street which leads farther to the north, and a
very big hut nearby.  You can hear the sound of snoring coming from inside 
the hut.  A stone building is across from the hut on the east side of the 
street, and a sign above the door says, "Community Warehouse."</LongDescription>
