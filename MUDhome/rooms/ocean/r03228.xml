  <ShortDescription>You are just outside the massive city gates of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceancrest is one of the largest cities in this part of the continent,
and as you stand out here and observe its walls, you note they must be
at least twenty meters high, with the guard towers and lookout stations
going even higher.  No wonder there has never been a successful invasion
of the city of Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
