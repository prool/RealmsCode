  <ShortDescription>You are in the southwest corner of the main courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east is a fenced garden where you see a great many trees and plants.
some of the plants grown there are used in the healing arts, while others
are said to have magical powers if mixed together in the right proportions.
of course, some of the plants are just food, but the garden is tended by
a select group of the castle's residents.  The entrance to the garden is
to the north.  Looking to the northeast you see a small fountain and pool.</LongDescription>
