  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Tranquility Way, near Highland Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the intersection with Highland Avenue and Orchard Lane coming
up to the southeast.  This rather large intersection is more or less the
northeastern corner of town, as Highland Avenue forms the eastern boundary
and the Military Headquarters to the north forms much of the northern 
boundary.</LongDescription>
