  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the southern path, deep within the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mysterious Shaman's hut is located to the north of the path.  You
can see a number of children being entertained by the witch doctor as
he blows fire from his hands.  The Shamen are an important part of the
barbarian's culture in that they provide most of the healing powers to
the wounded after battle.</LongDescription>
