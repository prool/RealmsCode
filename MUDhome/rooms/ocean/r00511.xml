  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street between the Fellowship Hall and the taxidermist.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hunting trophies are a big thing among many hunters, and Roger's Taxidermy
Shop has no problem providing magnificent stuffed heads and torsos of
any animal brought in to him.  On the west side of the road is the Great
Fellowship Hall, a strange group of fanatical religious philosophers who
probably think the world is going to end tomorrow.</LongDescription>
