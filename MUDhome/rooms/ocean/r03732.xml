  <ShortDescription>You are in a dimly lighted hallway upstairs in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room on the east side of the hallway used to be the private quarters
of the previous owner of this inn.  When it was discovered that he was a
leader in the anti-royalist terrorists, he was hanged in Dillsdale Memorial
Park in a public ceremony and his property was confiscated by the crown.
The Dragon Tooth Inn has been closed for a number of years now, and the
present owner has not yet done anything with this part of the building.</LongDescription>
