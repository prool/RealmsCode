  <ShortDescription>You are on Lelion Way, just west of the intersection with Necropolis Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's nothing really to see on the north side of the road except a lot
of stale swamp water.  There are supposed to be some good magical components
in the swamp, though.  On the south, you can see the back side of a large
shopping center, the entrance to which is located on the other side of the
building.  Necropolis Avenue is to the east.</LongDescription>
