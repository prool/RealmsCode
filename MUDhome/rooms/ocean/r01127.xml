  <LongDescription>This small city block boasts two somewhat large buildings on both the
north and south sides.  The entrances to these buildings are located 
off of Main Street.  Marina Way serves mostly as a back-road for the
delivery of supplies and other accessories to these booming businesses.
Marina Way is to the east and Main Street is to the west.</LongDescription>
