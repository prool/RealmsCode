  <ShortDescription>This is the hut of Mordith, the middle daughter of Mehetable the witch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is simple but elegant, with many musical instruments in view.
Mordith longs to be married, and her music is often about lost loves and
forgotten promises.  Her favorite instrument is the finely crafted lute you
see on the chair by the window.</LongDescription>
