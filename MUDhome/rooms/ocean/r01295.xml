  <ShortDescription>This simple cottage belongs to a woodsman who sells firewood.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small stone house has an earthen roof and no windows, but appears
to be clean and well maintained.  The chimney emits a good smelling
smoke, and there is also the smell of roasting meat.  The walk way
is lined with river rock, and flowers grow on the roof.  A small pen
of goats is around to the back.</LongDescription>
