  <ShortDescription>You are in a tight, narrow air vent in the Uland Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can only go in one direction because there is no room to turn around.
There's also no light in this dark shaft, and when it gets dark outside 
the little bit of sunlight that filters in will be gone.  The stones
about you feel very loose, and this place might collapse at any time.</LongDescription>
