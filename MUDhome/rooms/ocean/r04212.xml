  <Name>Level One Circular Hallway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The great hallway completely encircles the main courtyard of the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wooden door you see on the outside wall looks well used.  It probably
does not go directly out of the castle, but since the castle wall is so
wide at the ground level it might go someplace within the wall itself.</LongDescription>
