  <ShortDescription>Trapped!  As you enter the garden the gate slams shut behind you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The magical glow you felt radiating from the garden as you approached it
is now very intense.  There are rows of fabulously beautiful plants lining
the paths which lead up and down the inside of this garden, and the walls
form an area which, once inside, is surprisingly large.  You cannot see the
other end of the garden from where you stand as it simply fades into a
mystically white radiance.  The gate, which has shut behind you, looks
nothing like it did from the outside.  It is now a solid gold surface and
prevents you from looking back in that direction.</LongDescription>
