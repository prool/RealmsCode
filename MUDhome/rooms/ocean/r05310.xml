  <ShortDescription>This is a poorly maintained section of the great Lyanden Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The consortium of cities pays a contractor and his roadworkers to keep
the highway in good repair, but a band of Highwaymen have been operating
in this area lately, and the militia have not been able to get rid of them.
Probably the road will be repaired when the militia is successful.</LongDescription>
