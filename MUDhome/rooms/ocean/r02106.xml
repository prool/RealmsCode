  <ShortDescription>Although this looked like a simple hut outside, you are in a grand manor!</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Mehetable's home has at least six large rooms that you can see, and there
are more rooms upstairs.  Fine tapestries and silk rugs are everywhere,
and the furniture would be fit for a king.  Polished wood and rare brocades
were used in the making of the elegant furniture.</LongDescription>
