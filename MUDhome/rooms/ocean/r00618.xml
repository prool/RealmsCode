  <ShortDescription>You are on Avatar Boulevard, just west of Altihmin's Academy.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Altihmin's Academy of Advanced Fighting Techniques is a large facility
where very high level fighters go to train.  Training is very difficult
at high levels for fighters as they must prove themselves by fighting
a similar fighter of a more powerful level.  Only through this test can
any fighter advance to the higher levels.</LongDescription>
