  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, approaching the southwestern shopping areas.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nagaritha Drive is directly to the north of this point.  To the east,
you can see a large banner which reads "Dangerous Destinations: Guide
to the Universe."  The entrance appears to be around the corner off of
Nagaritha Drive.  There seems to be a bit of a ruckus towards the south.</LongDescription>
