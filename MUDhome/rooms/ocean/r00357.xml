  <ShortDescription>You are in the main public room of the Red Dog Saloon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The place is crowded and smoky, making it difficult to find a table.
As you look around you note that most of the patrons are pirates, and
that most of them are roaring drunk.  This might not be a fun place to
be for a landlubber.  There is a long, polished bar over at one side,
and a great many tables and chairs around the room.  A curtain covers
a small stage at the end of the room.</LongDescription>
