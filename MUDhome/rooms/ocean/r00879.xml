  <ShortDescription>This room is ominously wallpapered with charts of the human head.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Madame Nicolov is a world famous phrenologist who has given lectures at
all of the great universities on the meaning of head bumps and methods
for reading them.  A very low chair is in the center of the room, and
another, higher chair is directly behind it.  Standing nearby is an
armature with a human head mounted on it.  The mouth looks about ready
to speak, but the eyes are closed and the head remains silent.</LongDescription>
