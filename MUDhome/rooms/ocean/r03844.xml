  <ShortDescription>You are on the King's North Highway, not far from Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This close to the city there are plenty of farms and small villages that
supply the city with a great many products.  Of course, Oceancrest is almost
totally self-sufficient, but in time of peace they don't mind letting
outsiders bring their wares to the markets.</LongDescription>
