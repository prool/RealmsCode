  <Name>Hafnia Mountain Road</Name>
  <ShortDescription>West of the road is an ancient graveyard, part of Saint Anne's Retreat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Further west you can see the twin towers of the stone church and the
bell tower near the front.  The rear of the building appears to have a
small garden behind it.  Funny thing about graveyards, no matter how well
kept they are, they always seem to be haunted.  This one is not well kept.</LongDescription>
