and Alturis Road, running east to west.  The Gardens are to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Hanging Gardens of Kista are perhaps the most impressive monument
to any person ever built.  The giant monument has three levels and looks
like a great fountain with exotic plants and trees growing wherever there
is room.  The base of the monument is almost completely made of gold with 
scattered bits of platinum and silver to give it some contrast.</LongDescription>
