  <ShortDescription>Brownhaven Way continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several small but expensive shops can be seen along here.  Directly to the
west is a custom leather armor shop.  Frebadis, the old hobbit who runs
the shop brags that his great, great grandfater established the place when
Brownhaven was just a wide spot in the road to Oceancrest.  On the east
is a custom knife shop where you can buy a knife of any size.  For a little
extra, you can even get it enchanted.</LongDescription>
