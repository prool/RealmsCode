  <ShortDescription>You are in Marina Alley, which winds east to west.  Several shops are here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side of the alley you see a narrow stairwell going to the
second floor of a dilapidated building.  A sign hangs over the door, and
it appears this is the meeting place for a group of hobbits who like to
practice low-level magic.  Handwritten on the wall is, "Frodo Lives."
A storefront church is slightly to the west, and the alley twists out
of sight to the east.  Directly south is a post office branch.</LongDescription>
