  <ShortDescription>You are standing beneath a canopy of ropes criss-crossed between the
trees, and supporting an odd looking hut two meters over your head.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Most of the vegetation around you looks in good health, but toward the
back side of the house there is a steady trickle of acid, creating a
small stream flowing to the south.  The vegetation in that direction
has grown wildly and turned wierd colors, and writhes with a life of
its own.  A rope ladder hangs from the overhead canopy.</LongDescription>
