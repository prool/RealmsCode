  <ShortDescription>You are in the city of Oceancrest's charities and welfare office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not wishing to find starved bodies on the street, the city has provided
this office for the use of various religions to use as an outlet for
donated items.  Several chests are around the wall, and each contains
the things needed by the poor.  You may donate any items you do not need,
simply by putting them in the chests.   If you are in need, feel free to
help yourself to what ever you may find in them.  It's all free.  To take
everything is equivalent to robbing the poor, and to do so is to bring
the punishment of Styx down on you.  Please be prudent in what you take.</LongDescription>
