  <Name>Kista Amphitheater Grass Seating</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the grassy hill high up above the stage of the Amphitheater.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The grass seating here was actually unintentional.  This area was not
developed, so when the Amphitheater became such a success, the regular
seating was no longer sufficent and people began sitting up on the grass.
Pretty soon, the grass seating area was permanently made a part of the
Amphitheater.  On some occasions, even all this space isn't enough.
The stage area is north of here.</LongDescription>
