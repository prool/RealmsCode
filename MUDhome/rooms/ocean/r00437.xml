  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Delaney Drive, east of the Guard Surplus shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Guard Surplus and Supply shop located on the west side of the road
provides a number of useful armors and weapons used by the city guards.
Of course these weapons are used, and can't be expected to be worth much
more than souveniers.  On the east side of the road is the Cathedral of
Worldly Bliss.</LongDescription>
