  <ShortDescription>You are on Avernus, which is the first plane of the Nine Hells.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Avernus is the top layer of the Nine Hells, the plane of evil where evil
manifests itself.  This plane is a rocky wasteland, guarded by hideous
demons, ferocious dragons and unnatural devils.  Avernus is the most
heavily guarded level of the Nine Hells, and you're likely to meet much
resistance in this deadly realm.  The gateway to Dis, the second plane
of the Nine Hells is guarded by Tiamat himself.</LongDescription>
