  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way south of the Golden Dolphin Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Golden Dolphin Inn was named after the road and caters to the average
crusader tracking their way across the wilderness.  There are stables to
the east of here just past the Hafnia Way intersection.  There is a small
Saloon called the Rusty Nail off of Main Street in the same block which
provides a fairly laid-back atmosphere to drink and socialize without the
hassle of being in the "in" crowd.</LongDescription>
