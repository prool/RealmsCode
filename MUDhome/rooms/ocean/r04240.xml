  <ShortDescription>You are at the southwest corner of the great open courtyard of Castle Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a ramp here that leads up to the battlements on the west side of
of the Tower Castle over the front gates.  The castle, built on the steep
side of a mountain, needs to be defended from only the west side.  The ramp
is wide and looks like a lot of troops could be moved quickly over it.</LongDescription>
