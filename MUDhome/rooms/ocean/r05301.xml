  <ShortDescription>This is the East Gate of the City of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are outside the east gate of the greatest city in the Land of Mordor. 
The gate is never open after sunset, for fear that mountain trolls will
overrun this weak part of the eastern city wall.  Looking east, you see a
wide, well traveled road which disappears over a small hill not far away.
Occasionally members of the city guard will come out here in the evening
to show each other how brave they are.</LongDescription>
