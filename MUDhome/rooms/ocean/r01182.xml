  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, north of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Necropolis reaches the road at this point.  You can look to the 
south through the iron bars which surround the Necropolis and see that
you wouldn't really want to be trapped in there at night.  The large
trees and statues almost seem to take on a life of their own as light
reflects off in different directions.  On the north side of the road is
Bushman Farms, an orchard where apples, oranges and other delicious 
fruits are grown.</LongDescription>
