  <ShortDescription>You are in the sleeping chambers of the dungeon guards.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There doesn't seem to be any order in the lower ranks.  In fact, there's
no discipline visible.  The room is a mess and the guards probably like 
it that way.  This place probably get's pretty busy so it's probably not
a good idea to stand out in the open.</LongDescription>
