  <Name>Through the Mist</Name>
  <ShortDescription>As you enter the room, you are enveloped in a strange glowing mist.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mist around you has become quite thick, and it glows with bright
color.  You look more carefully and notice that the color is formed
by light playing around the transparent edges of an amorphous shape
which slowly shifts shape around you.</LongDescription>
