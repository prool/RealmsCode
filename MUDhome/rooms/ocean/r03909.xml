  <ShortDescription>You are in the meeting room of some very high level thieves.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only seasoned adventurers are allowed in here, and training classes are
conducted for mid-level thieves in the side rooms.  At the moment, all
master training thieves are either serving time or out on a job, so if
you want to advance in level without a fight, this is your lucky day.
Just go to the training room and pickup your advancement.</LongDescription>
