  <Name>Amberton Lane/Kafkan Way Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Kafkan Way and Amberton Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Kafkan Way heads off to the east from here, ending at the Necropolis.
If the Keslarian Mages didn't create their castle right on this spot,
Amberton Lane would continue to the south.  Unfortunately, the mages 
did erect their palace on this spot, and Amberton Lane was destroyed.
The large, looming castle appears to the southeast, high up a large
mountain face.</LongDescription>
