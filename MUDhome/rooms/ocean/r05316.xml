  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on the King's Highway, known as Lyanden Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lyanden Road connects several of the towns and cities to the east with the
great city of Oceancrest.  Several crossroads lead to important villages
and towns as well.  Prince Ragnar's castle is southeast of here, near the
Vallenda Pass.  The trail seems to shortcut the road.</LongDescription>
