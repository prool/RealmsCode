  <ShortDescription>You are in a large but run down tavern known as Thackery's Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A lot of mismatched furniture is scattered throughout the room, and a
fire burns in a large fireplace.  A group of loud singers are gathered
at one end of the room, and a number of girls carry wine to the customers
at the tables.  This place is frequented mostly by farmers and local
merchants, and they all seem to be having a good time.  A few field 
hands and grape pickers are playing darts.</LongDescription>
