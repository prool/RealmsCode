  <ShortDescription>You are on Hofton Avenue, which runs parallel to the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The northern City Walls are quite impressive, standing more than ten
meters high at some places, and higher at others.  The wall was designed
to keep out invading hordes of barbarians and other aggressive foes. 
After the walls were built, no attack on Oceancrest has been successful.</LongDescription>
