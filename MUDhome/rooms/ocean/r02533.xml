  <ShortDescription>You are on Kista Avenue traveling north-south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a flower shop that specializes in rare and exotic plants and flowers
on the east side of the avenue.  A retired botanist lives in the quarters
above the shop, although some whisper that he isn't really retired, but 
simply found something in his research that he didn't want to share with
the University.  They say he continues his research in secret now.</LongDescription>
