  <ShortDescription>You are on Necropolis Avenue, just west of the Shrines of Life and Death.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The philosophy of good vs. evil has long been a topic of great debate among
clerics and philosophers for ages.  The Shrine of Death opposes the Shrine
of Life, forming the perfect union.  This cycle of life and death is the
center of the clerical mystique, to which all clerics must struggle to
understand.</LongDescription>
