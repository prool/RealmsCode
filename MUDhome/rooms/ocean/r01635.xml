  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking along Leviathan Drive, east of the Keslar Palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large mountain of dirt has strangely risen on the west side of the 
road, where the Keslar Palace stands.  The sheer cliffs which run up
the virtually impossible mountain prevent people from entering the 
Palace except through the proper route.  On the west is a large black-
smith's shop and a couple of other smaller shops.</LongDescription>
