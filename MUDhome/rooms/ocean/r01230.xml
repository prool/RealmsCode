  <ShortDescription>You are on Lankshire Parkway, east of the Oceancrest Stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Oceancrest Stables and Walking Yards are located to the west
of Lankshire Parkway, where guests and visitors to the town may leave
their steeds while visiting.  Horses, although permitted in town, create
a hazard to the pedestrians on the road.  Since it's not really safe for
either the horse or the people, most just leave them in the stables.</LongDescription>
