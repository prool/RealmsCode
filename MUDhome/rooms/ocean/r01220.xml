  <LongDescription>Overland drive is one of the longest streets in Oceancrest and has the
unique feature of being the road which runs between the Manor of
Natasha de Allisk and the mysterious Necropolis.  Nagaritha Drive runs
east and west from one end of the city to the other.  On the southwest
corner of the intersection is the local favorite, Thackery's Pub.  The
main entrance to the pub is on Nagaritha Drive, but there is also an
entrance on Overland Drive.</LongDescription>
