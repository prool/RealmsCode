  <ShortDescription>You are standing near the edge of a long bed of glowing coals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The heat from the coals makes the air shimmer, distorting figures of
dancing images on the other side of the pit.  A black man stands in
the middle of the pits, wearing nothing but a pair of white canvas pants,
and laughs as he waves for you to join him.  the live coals beneath his
bare feet sizzle and pop as he waits for you.</LongDescription>
