  <ShortDescription>You are walking through one of the more peaceful sections of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road, you can see the large Bushman Farms estate
where various fruit trees of nearly every variety grow in plenty.  The
peace and quiet of the road is only interrupted by the occassional shouts
of encouragement from the Ivanhouse Sporting Facility, located to the west.</LongDescription>
