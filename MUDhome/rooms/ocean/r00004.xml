  <ShortDescription>This is a short alley between Wall Road West and Brownhaven Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Wall Road West is very close to here, and a hodge-podge of shops line
the alley on the north side.  There is a high fence on the south side.
It looks like you can buy just about anything you ever imagined in these
run-down little places.  A lot of shopkeepers wave merchandise at you.</LongDescription>
