  <Name>Melbourne Avenue/Waterfront Way Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Waterfront Way and Melbourne Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Melbourne Avenue runs north from Waterfront Way, heading past the infamous
Melbourne Entertainment Arena, where criminals and other less appreciated
members of society are put to their deaths by throwing them into the arena
to be stones, skewered or otherwise mutilated in a horrible death.  This
tends to keep crime in the city down, though.</LongDescription>
