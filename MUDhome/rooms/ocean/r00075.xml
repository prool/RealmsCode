  <ShortDescription>This part of the arena is made for champions.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only the champions from previous fights are allowed in here, and this is
the part of the arena that is the most packed with blood-thirsty crowds.
There is bloody sawdust on the floor, and a few pieces of bodies that 
were not picked up when the cleaning crew was at work.  Remember, your
opponent has already won all of his previous fights.</LongDescription>
