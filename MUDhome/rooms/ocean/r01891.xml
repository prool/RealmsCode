  <ShortDescription>You are in the Custom Swords shop in Leonardo's Foundry.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Various types of weapons may be purchased from Leonardo here, but his
specialty is swords.  Almost every known type of sword may be purchased
here.  There are a couple of gold swords also for sale as well, but 
since gold is so soft, they do not make very good weapons.  They are
worth quite a bit, though, more as collector's items.</LongDescription>
