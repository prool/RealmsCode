  <ShortDescription>You are in a resting area near a large fountain and quiet pool.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A number of trees surround this area, making it a quiet and peaceful place
to relax.  Directly to the north is the famous statue of King Lyanden and
Prince Ragnar, while to the south is the southern tunnel through the back
part of the castle.  A hedge separates this area from the east side of the
courtyard, muffling the sounds you hear coming from there.</LongDescription>
