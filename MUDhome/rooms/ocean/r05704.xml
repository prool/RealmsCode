  <Name>Phexton Road/Hildor Lane Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a dusty intersection of roads at the entrance to Phexton Village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You see a village of Mountain Giants, each well over six meters tall. 
Large homes and shops are on both the east and west sides of the central
park which is in the center of the village.  There is an inn on the east
side of the road, and a rather noisy sounding pub on the west side.  The
wide Phexton Road goes down the mountain to the southwest.</LongDescription>
