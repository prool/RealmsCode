  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, south of the DeNail Corn Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The DeNail Corn Fields provide much of the corn required by many of the
ranches for their herds, as well as for public consumption.  Corn is one
of the more basic commodities of the town, and such as it is, it usually
fetches a high price.  The Oceancrest Stables and Walking Yards are 
located on the south side of the street.</LongDescription>
