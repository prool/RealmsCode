  <Name>Renee's Elven Leather Works</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very fancy elven shop filled with exotic leather items.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Leather is one of the easiest hides to work with and elves have mastered
the art of making goods with the fine hides.  A variety of imported elven
leather works have been put on sale here and line the walls.  The most
common are suits of leather which protect slightly better than normal
leather suits because they are custom-fitted for each individual.  It
is an outstanding choice for mages and thieves who rely on light, easy
to wear armor.</LongDescription>
