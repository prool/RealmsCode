  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lankshire Parkway, east of the Khelleva Mansion.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see clearly the Khelleva Mansion and Estate to the west.  The
Mansion is constructed of marble and concrete, making it a virtual
fortress against any attack.  Before Oceancrest was founded and the
City Walls built, the Khelleva Mansion was about the only structure 
that actually survived attacks against it.</LongDescription>
