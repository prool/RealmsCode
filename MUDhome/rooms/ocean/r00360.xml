  <ShortDescription>You are at the end of an alley which connects to Rum Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small grate has been removed from its vault in the ground, exposing
a narrow entry to the cellar below the old wooden building here.
Large black cats prowl the alley, and several look at you hungrily.  A
body of a sailor is decomposing on the ground, partially hidden by rags
and trash.  A couple of the larger cats crouch beside the body.</LongDescription>
