  <ShortDescription>You are walking in a long tunnel.  Your boots echo in both directions.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are structural signs of some sort of a disaster here.  Great stones
are dislodged from their normal places, and there are cracks in the floor
and walls.  It looks as though the temple was shaken by a giant hand.</LongDescription>
