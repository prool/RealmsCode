  <Name>Sunken Pirate Ship</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the port side, near the stern, of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the strangest thing you notice about the Snap Dragon is that it appears
to be a ship ready for action, with decks cleared and sails unfurled.
It looks like the ship was sunk only a few minutes ago, yet you know the
Oceancrest Navy did the dirty deed years ago.  Everything you can see
is apparently in place and ready to use.  How odd.</LongDescription>
