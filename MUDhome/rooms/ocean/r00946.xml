here, and Rue Caledonia is the wide street going from north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the central part of the city, and a small park is located in the 
center of the intersection.  A statue and park benches are under beautiful
lavender trees in flower.  The natives say the trees flower all year long.
The elves erected a statue to some of the adventurers from other races who
helped them in their time of trouble with the dragons and the cowardly
mountain trolls.</LongDescription>
