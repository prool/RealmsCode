  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Golden Dolphin Way, running east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Stable and Walking Yards are located on the north side of
the road and provide long-term services to visitors and guests that come
to Oceancrest on horseback.  Horses are allowed in town, but they are
dangerous both to the themselves and the citizens walking along the streets.
It doesn't take that much to scare a horse.</LongDescription>
