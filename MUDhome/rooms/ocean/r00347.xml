  <Name>Kishijoten's Sushi Bar</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a rather large sushi bar named after the goddess Kishijoten.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Kishijoten is the goddess of luck in many of the eastern cultures on
the other side of the island.  Iisika, the founder of the bar, decided
to pay homage to her favorite goddess and luck has not ceased to shine
upon her very popular business.  Fresh fish and other seafood is a
delicacy among many of the eastern cultures as well as many of the
oceanic cultures, who will often show up here to talk and have something
to eat.</LongDescription>
