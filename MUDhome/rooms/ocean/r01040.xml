  <Name>Oceanview Drive/Hillcrest Drive Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Hillcrest Drive and Oceanview Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceanview Drive is a rather scenic route used primarily by visitors to
Oceancrest to get out of the crowded Main Street.  It runs from the
Nylandian Bay to the south wall and southern shopping district.  Hillcrest
is another large road which provides primary access to most of the 
large estates located to the east in the fairly well-off sections of
Oceancrest.  The Dragon Tooth Inn is north of here.</LongDescription>
