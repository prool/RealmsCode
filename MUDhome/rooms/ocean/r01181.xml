  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, south of the Bushman Farms.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large farmland to the north provides much of the fruits and vege-
tables to the people of Oceancrest.  Being located next to the Necropolis,
there's not much else one can do.  Reginald Bushman makes a good living
harvesting the fruits and vegetables in his orchards, and can often use
some unskilled labor to rid the garden of unwanted pests.</LongDescription>
