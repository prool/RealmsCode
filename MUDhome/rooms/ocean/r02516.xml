  <ShortDescription>You are traveling east-west on Myrr Lane, north of the Great Observatory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A very large but ruined building stands on the north side of the lane.
Kista is a city devoted to research and the advancement of knowledge, but
the Institute of Investigations into Ball Lightning simply ran a particular
experiment with too little safeguards.  Part of the building was destroyed,
but you see there were several left intact. </LongDescription>
