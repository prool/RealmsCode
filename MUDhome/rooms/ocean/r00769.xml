  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, south of Wakarimasu Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Kobiyo Observatory, located to the north on the grounds of the 
Wakarimasu Park, is one of the few scientific stations dedicated towards
astronomy and astrophysics.  Very few people have time to deal with
such trivialities in everyday life, but it is somewhat interesting to
visit every so often.</LongDescription>
