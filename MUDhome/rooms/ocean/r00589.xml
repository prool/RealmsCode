  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, west of the elven Shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Elven Shrine of Corellon Larethian, the elven god of everthing that
is, lies to the west of here.  The magnificent Shrine was built centuries
ago by the elves who used to live in the area.  There are still many elves
who follow Larethian's banner, but the number of elves in Oceancrest has
diminished over the years.</LongDescription>
