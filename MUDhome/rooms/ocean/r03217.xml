  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern shore of Lake Kista, near Gotland Pass.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is certainly not a lifeless lake, as you see a lot of activity in
the water as you stand here.  From here it looks like it might be easy
to wade in the lake rather than stay on the shore.  Most of the rocks
at the water's edge appear to be quite slippery.</LongDescription>
