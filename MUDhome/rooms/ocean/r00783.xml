  <ShortDescription>You are in a magnificant orange hallway composed completely of orange
jacinith gemstones.  The passage continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Upon careful examination of the corridor, you notice that you cannot
in fact go east without breaking your neck.  As you walk east, you
bump into a large crystal object that acts like a giant mirror.  The
mirror is so proportioned that the corridor at which you are looking 
appears to go straight through to the iron gate. </LongDescription>
