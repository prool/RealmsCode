  <Name>Whirlpool Below the Cliffs</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are being swirled around and around in a whirlpool below the cliffs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You could probably swim away from this whirlpool if you wanted, it doesn't
seem to be that strong, but if you are curious you will see where it takes
you.  The cliffs are almost directly overhead, but the whirlpool seems to
be pulling things down a little closer to the cliffs in the north.</LongDescription>
