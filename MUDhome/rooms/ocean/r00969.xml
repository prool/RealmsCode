  <Name>The Widow Maker - Below Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are down on the lower deck of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is not a good place to be if you get sea sick often.  The continuous
rocking of the boat, even in the Nylandian Bay, makes walking tough and
keeping your lunch down even tougher.  There is a stairway that leads up
to the main deck and the hallway continues to the north.</LongDescription>
