  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Wakeforest Drive, running north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road, you can see the mysterious Dragon's Citadel.
No one has really had the guts to go into the Citadel for ages, so no
one really knows what goes on inside the haunted halls of the long
abandoned old church.  The entrance to the Citadel is located on the
north side of Neilian Drive.</LongDescription>
