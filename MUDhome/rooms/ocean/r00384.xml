  <ShortDescription>You are on a small bridge on Orchard Lane crossing a trickling stream.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small stream appears to be the only thing that can get in and out of
the forests on both sides of the road.  Unfortunately, the river is very
shallow and appears to be the nesting ground of a few unfriendly looking
alligators and other beasts.</LongDescription>
