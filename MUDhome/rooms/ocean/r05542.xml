  <ShortDescription>You are near the western end of the northern path, in Glabor Gulley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path meanders randomly across the northen face of the gulley, passing
near the entrances to many of the caves you see farther east.  A large clump
of bushes hides a portion of the path immediately east, but as you look
down, you see many campfires and dark, troll-like figures gathered there.</LongDescription>
