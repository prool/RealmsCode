  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern tower stairwell which winds around the large tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tall tower seems to make the stairway seemingly endless.  Every time
you go further up, it seems like you haven't moved at all.  The stairway
smells of mildew and mold, as if it hasn't been used ages.  There's a faint 
perfumed odor that seems to be coming from the top of the tower.</LongDescription>
