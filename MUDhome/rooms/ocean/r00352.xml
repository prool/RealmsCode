  <Name>Uland Island Dock</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a long dock standing out from a village on Uland Island.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The island is famous for the strong rum it makes and exports, but there
is very little else here.  That is, unless you count the long line of
pubs, bars and saloons that line the single road in the village.  Most
of the island is uninhabited except for the dwarves who work in the
distillery, and the shopkeepers who run the saloons.  And of course, 
there are the women who live in the large red house at the north end
of the village's single road.  Young ladies go there to learn a trade.</LongDescription>
