  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, south of the Klondike Wheat Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vast wheat fields continue on for miles in apparently all directions
on the north side of the road.  The wheat is used by many of the local
bakeries to bake fresh breads and pasteries.  Luckily, Oceancrest grows
so much wheat, there is seldom ever a shortage.  Most of the excess grain
gets stored away in the silos, but some is exported out of the city to
other less fortunate cities.</LongDescription>
