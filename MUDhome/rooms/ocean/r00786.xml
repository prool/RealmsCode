  <ShortDescription>You appear to have ventured into another room inside this vast mirrored
wasteland.  You can barely make out the room to the north but as you
venture further south, the north room seems to blend into the south one.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Upon considering how good life has been to you so far, you stop to rest
along one of the mirrors you've bumped into.  Bones lie scattered about
this room (but strangely, not in the north room).  Another note lies on
the floor that you almost overlook.  It says: "What to do if you encounter
the ravenous beast of Traal.  Wrap your head with a towel, being sure to
cover your eyes.  The beast of Traal is so stupid that it thinks that if
you can't see it, it can't see you and goes about it's business.  Since
you left your towel behind, your other option is to run away, terribly
fast."  You continue to bang your head against the crystal wall.</LongDescription>
