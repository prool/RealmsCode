  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Overland Drive and Oceanview Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have come to a rather busy intersection.  Each of the four corners
of the intersection seem to be quite busy with activity.  On the north-
east, there's the Guard Headquarters.  To the northwest is the Prison
(or Detention and Rehabilitation Center).  To the southeast is the 
Dragon Tooth Inn, one of the more luxurious inns in Oceancrest.  And
to the southwest is Dillsdale Memorial Park, which is used for official
gatherings and public announcements.  </LongDescription>
