  <ShortDescription>You are in the necropolis administration building.  Is it a plot you want?</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A clerk behind a simple desk greets you as you enter the building.  You
saw the clerk flinch as you came in, probably surprised that anyone would
be here at this time.  They must not do much business.  The clerk tells
you that you can sometimes find the undertaker here, as he is in charge
of the Necropolis and probably knows everything you want to know about it.
You should speak to him.</LongDescription>
