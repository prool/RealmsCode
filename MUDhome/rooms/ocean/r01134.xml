  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just north of the Millwood Office Building.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rosecrest Street takes a turn towards the southwest as it reaches the
City Wall.  Beyond the high City Wall to the west lies the Respitial Sea,
which has claimed many ships and sailor's lives throughout the years.  The 
Wall not only protects the city from invaders, but also from the Sea God 
when he gets angry and sends twenty meter waves crashing on the shore. </LongDescription>
