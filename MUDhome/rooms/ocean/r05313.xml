  <Name>Lyanden Road/Forest Road Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Lyanden Road and Forest Road.  Lyanden Road
runs east and west, while Forest Road continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lyanden Road is wide and well maintained, but it looks like Forest Road
could use a little work.  The trees seem to hang excessively low as you look
to the north.  You can't see very far to the west, but a road sign says
that Oceancrest is in that direction.  It also says Brownhaven is east. </LongDescription>
