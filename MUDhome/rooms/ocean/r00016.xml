  <ShortDescription>You are on Goldenrod Avenue, which is the northern boundary of Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road is badly paved, and a great many potholes have been untended
for a very long time.  There is a busted wagon standing in the roadway,
blocking most of the road.  On the south side of the road is the Begger's
Guild.  No one is allowed to beg in the streets of Brownhaven unless they
are a member of the guild, and pay membership dues.  The door appears to
be heavy oak with a gold door knocker.</LongDescription>
