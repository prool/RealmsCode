  <ShortDescription>You are south of the intersection of the Foothills Trail and the Ashton
River Road.  To the southeast is the dwarven community of Nyyron.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dwarves make a pretty good living by mining the foothills, but some of
the best ores come from deep under the mountains you see far to the east.
The dwarves have never said how deep their tunnels go.</LongDescription>
