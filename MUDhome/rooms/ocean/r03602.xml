  <ShortDescription>You are standing in a great hallway, under the massive arch of Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The corridor is a north-south connection between the castle's courtyard and
the great gate at the drawbridge.  Directly south is a busy intersection
where the corridor seems to widen before leading to the courtyard.  There
is a cross corridor in that direction.  As you look about you, you realize
that each stone in the arch overhead must weigh at least six tons.  What a
marvel of construction is this castle.</LongDescription>
