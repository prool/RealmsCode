  <ShortDescription>You are on a broad ledge in the interior of a huge redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>directly overhead there is a trapdoor, and as you look across the empty space
between you and the center core of the great tree, you realize there is a
door over there.  There is no place to stand, but the door seems to open
into the heart of the mighty tree, while the trapdoor opens above you.</LongDescription>
