  <ShortDescription>You are on East Ulandia, traveling in a north-south direction.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A row of some of the better shops for this part of the village are on
the east side of the road.  There seems to be small living quarters
above each shop, and the sidewalk is swept clean in front each store.
A wooden sign swings in the breeze over the door of a store that seems
to specialize in leather armor for mages.</LongDescription>
