  <Name>Orange Jacinith Hallway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a magnificant hallway composed completely of crystal jacinith
continuing to the north and east.  There is a mirror directly to the
west which forces the passage to turn towards the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mirror is oddly placed at a 45 degree angle to the two hallways.
In the mirror, you can see yourself walking towards yourself in a 
very wierd optical illusion.  Or is it an illusion?  As you look into
the mirror to the west, you see a seemingly endless hallway.  Turning
to the east, you can still see the magnificent crystal intersection.</LongDescription>
