  <LongDescription>The salamander is a giant, demon-like creature from the depths of the
elemental plane of fire.  The cave in intensely warm and feels almost
like you're standing in a fire.  The rest of the cave is otherwise
empty and has nothing of real value.  Besides, almost any object in 
here for more than a short period of time would probably melt or burn.</LongDescription>
