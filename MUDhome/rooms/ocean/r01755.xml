  <ShortDescription>You are on Kafkan Way, running parallel with the City Walls to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Occasionally, you can see a couple of guards patrolling the City Walls,
watching out for invasion forces.  No one is really stupid enough to try
to invade Oceancrest, but the threat always exists.  The only people who
really venture out past the City Walls are caravans and mercenaries looking
for a quick gold piece.</LongDescription>
