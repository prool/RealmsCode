  <ShortDescription>You are at the western end of a wildlife preserve in Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The area is rather hevily wooded, although you can see there are few trees
on the path which climbs to the west.  There is a rocky cliff face on the
south side of the park, and you can see some huge bird nests up there.  No,
not just huge.  Those nests are really big!  High overhead, above the wide
Lithium Inlet on the north side, you see the birds that must inhabit those
nests.  Must be the biggest birds in existance.</LongDescription>
