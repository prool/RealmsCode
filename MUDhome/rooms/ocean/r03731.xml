  <ShortDescription>You are in a suite normally kept for out-of-town royal visitors.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>When the Inn was remodeled, a secret passage was found in the wall in this
room.  It led to a meeting room for anti-royalist terrorists.  The owner 
of the inn was hanged in a public ceremony after it was discovered he was
a member of that group.  Several viscounts were murdered in this very room.
There are dark stains on the floor which workmen said would never come out,
and the secret passage has been boarded and sealed.</LongDescription>
