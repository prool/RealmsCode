  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret passage on the west side of the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wall has buckled and you must squeeze sideways if you want to continue
in either direction.  It looks as though another passage connected here
long ago, and probably ran to the west, but now there is nothing but debris
in that direction.  Looks like it is impossible to go that way.</LongDescription>
