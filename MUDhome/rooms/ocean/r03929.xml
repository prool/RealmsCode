  <ShortDescription>You are in the western end of the Wizard's Eye ruby hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are three arches here, and you will find your way if you try them.
Flickering lights behind ruby panels cast moving shadows on the walls and
floor.  Each shadow seems to have a face and form, and each tries to gain
your attention.  The shadows pull at your robes and scream silently in
your ear.  Ignore them.</LongDescription>
