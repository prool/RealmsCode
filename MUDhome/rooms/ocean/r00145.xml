  <ShortDescription>East Ulandia continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A row of nice little shops are on the east side of the road, each appearing
to be clean and neat.  There's a wild-game butcher shop directly east, and
next door to that is a tiny little restaurant with chairs and tables set
out on the walk so that customers can enjoy the view of the river.</LongDescription>
