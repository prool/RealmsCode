  <Name>Main Street/Goldenrod Avenue</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Main Street and Goldenrod Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street comes to an end here at Goldenrod Avenue but it continues to
the south.  Main Street is the broadest street in the village of Brownhaven.
Most of the more respectable businesses and shops are to the south of you.
There is a very wide gate set in the north village wall, and you can see a
dusty road leaving the village heading into the foothils.  The shabby
looking building on the southeast corner is a warehouse and camel stable  
for the caravans which arrive monthly.</LongDescription>
