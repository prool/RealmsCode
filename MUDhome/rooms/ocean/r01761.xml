  <ShortDescription>You are on Kafkan Way, just north of the Iilandi University Library.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Iilandi University Library is one of the largest facilities of its
kind in Oceancrest, surpassed only the by the Ministry of Knowledge in
southwestern Oceancrest.  On the north side of the road is the Odinialli
Memorial Administration Building where various schedules and forms are
lost for the public good.  That good of course being that if the forms 
were lost, the administrators would have something to do, thus would not
be fired, and not contribute to the unemployment level of the city.</LongDescription>
