  <ShortDescription>You are at a bend in the road where Hofton turns to the west and northeast.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hofton Avenue turns to the southeast as it approaches the Oceancrest 
Military Headquarters, which you can see to the east.  To the south, you
can see the East Oceancrest City Guard Barracks, where the guards and
other personnel are housed.  Much of Oceancrest's economy depends on
the military force keeping barbarian cultures outside of Oceancrest from
breaching the city walls. </LongDescription>
