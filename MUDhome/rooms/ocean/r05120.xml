  <Name>Dark Tempest Over Castle Kayleigh</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a swirling dark tempest over the burned Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From this height you can see that only a single turreted tower remains
standing in the fire-blackened ruin.  However, the stone deck of the tower
looks quite sturdy, and big enough for the copper dragon to land.  Odd,
but there's not a tree or bush within a mile of the old castle.  The moat
is still there, but the drawbridge burned away long ago.  Looks like the
only entrance is by air.</LongDescription>
