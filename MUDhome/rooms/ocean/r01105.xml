  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, between two small shopping centers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large building on the south houses three small shops.  The door on
the south reads "Eye of the Dragon Fine Gems" in glittering platinum.
There are two more doors to the west along Waterfront Way.  On the north
side of the road is another building.  A large golden sign with a mean
looking red dragon appears to say "DRAGONWARES".  The massive metal door
to the north is an entrance into this strange shop.</LongDescription>
