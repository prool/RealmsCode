  <ShortDescription>This is a steep path high over the North Highway out of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wind is cold here, and the path is covered with patches of ice.  This 
trail gets colder and even more rugged in the westward direction where you  
see the base of an ice and snow covered mountain.  The path drops pretty
quickly to the southeast.</LongDescription>
