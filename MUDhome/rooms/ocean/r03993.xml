  <ShortDescription>You are in a smooth bore of a tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Its the strangest tunnel you have ever been in, probably, because the walls
seems to be made of a fused silicon and earth, like glass.  A soft glow
emanates from the walls.  You can feel fresh air on your cheek, coming from
the southeast direction.</LongDescription>
