  <ShortDescription>You are at the water's edge of Lake Kista, enjoying the view and air.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Birds wheel in the air and occasionly dip to the water's surface, scooping
up small fish and other marine life.  The lake looks inviting enough to
take a swim, but who knows what might be out there?  It's probably better
to be safe than sorry, and staying on the shore is a prudent action.</LongDescription>
