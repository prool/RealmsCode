  <ShortDescription>You are on Brownhaven Way, one of the better north-south streets.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Brownhaven Ladies Garden supply is located on the east side of the road.
Next door is the Roseleaf Tea and Cakes restaurant, where only the most
elite of Brownhaven's ladies gather.  There's an unfounded rumor that
more than tea and cakes can be found in the back room of the little shop,
however.</LongDescription>
