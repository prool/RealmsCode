  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Appleton Road between the ranch and slaughterhouse.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Circle-Bar Cattle Ranch is located to the east of the road where the
cattle are born, fed and nurtured, and then shipped across Appleton Road
to the Slaughterhouse where they are humanely destroyed and sold to the
civilians as meat for their daily diets.  The large number of cattle that
go through the Slaughterhouse daily leaves a nice river of blood running
down Appleton Road.</LongDescription>
