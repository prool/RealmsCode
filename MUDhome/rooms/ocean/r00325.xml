  <ShortDescription>You are in the Main Hallway running through the Bendine Aquarium.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This section of the Main Hallway runs through the pirahna exhibit.  The
Pirahna Pit, as it is so named, lies to the west.  Although the small
fish are not very powerful or strong, they tend to travel in packs, 
making them a very deadly threat to their victim.  Encouraging them by
jumping into the pirahna pool is not recommended.</LongDescription>
