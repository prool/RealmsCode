  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Adlermann Way, west of the City Guard Officer's Club.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The City Guard Officer's Club is one of the most exclusive bars in 
Oceancrest.  The guards and other patrol personnel don't really like to
see outsiders in their personal clubs, so it might not be a really good
idea to go in there without a very heavy escort.</LongDescription>
