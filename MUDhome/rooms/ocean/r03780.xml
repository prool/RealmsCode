  <ShortDescription>You are at a small cove on the Lithium Inlet, in the wildlife preserve.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The waters of the inlet swirl and eddy here, not moving near as fast
as the center of the inlet to the north.  The banks leading to the
water's edge are grassy and inviting, and a wooden pier, apparently
in good condition, extends into the clean and cold water.</LongDescription>
