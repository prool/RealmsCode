  <ShortDescription>You are crouching under the grandstand at the Seaside Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Peanuts and popcorn shower down on top of you from the grandstand
as you crouch uncomfortably under the crowds of people.  You had
best be careful, for you never know what awful things those pesty
village children might drop from the stands.  There is an awful 
stench down here, due mainly to the sticky, moldy foods dropped
from above and the hoards of stray dogs and cats which have made
their homes here where the maintenance people must come to chase
them away.  Find your way out before you fall victim to the pesti-
lence breeding here.  The noise which comes from the north is your
clue that the center ring might be in that direction.</LongDescription>
