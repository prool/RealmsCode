  <ShortDescription>You are on Lake View Road, between Lake Kista and the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lake is higher and to the north and towards the east, but it is said
to be an easy climb from here.  Kista is close by in the southern direction.
Kista is known far and wide throughout the Land of Mordor as a beautiful
place to visit, with wonderful gardens and pleasant people.  Many of the
political decisions that affect the entire land are made here, because
politicians also recognize the beauty of Kista and hold many conferences
in the famous Towers of Kista.</LongDescription>
