  <ShortDescription>This old bedroom hasn't been slept in for decades.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>An old canopy bed rests against the northern wall, completely covered in
cobwebs and dust.  An occasional spider can be seen walking across its
moth-eaten covers.  A portrait of a handsome woman hangs on the eastern
wall.  Strangely enough it has not been harmed over the years by wear and
tear.  The same cannot be said, however, for the room's wallpaper.  It's
full of blotchy holes where spiders and other little critters now live.</LongDescription>
