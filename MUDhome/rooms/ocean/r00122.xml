  <ShortDescription>Goldenrod Avenue continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a number of small shops and stores along the south side of the
road.  There's nothing but a great, brown wall on the other side.  The
brown color of the wall is how the village got its name, by the way.  Atop
the wall you can see a few lounging village militia, who are supposed to
be on lookout duty.  Mostly they just look for pretty girls on this side
of the wall, however.</LongDescription>
