  <Name>Crystalline Tavern Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a tunnel of a seemingly infinite number of beautiful crystals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vibration of your steps cause the crystals to resonate with harmonics
which echo and re-echo throughout the cavern.  The beautiful and natural
crystals look much like the ones you have seen which carry enchantments 
and are used by the people who understand magic.  The tunnel slopes down
in the western direction, and a sparkling light appears there.</LongDescription>
