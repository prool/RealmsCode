  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, between Marina Way and Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small section of road connects Main Street with Marina Way, both
running north to south.  Directly to the north is the Sleeping Deer
Real Estate Office, where many people go to purchase land for development
in Oceancrest.  There are quite a few places that are still under
construction, even in a town as old as Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
