  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, east of the Shrine of Gruumsh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Orcs have built a large shrine in dedication to Gruumsh, the orc god
of all that is and will be.  He is said to rule over the other orcish 
gods with an iron fist and never sleeps.  Gruumsh is not a very friendly
god, but when you're omnipotent, it doesn't really matter.</LongDescription>
