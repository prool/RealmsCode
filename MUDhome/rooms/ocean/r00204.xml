  <ShortDescription>This is the kitchen where large meals were obviously meant to be prepared.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A huge oven, a kettle and a large rinse sink cover the east and south
walls of this kitchen.  Like everything else in this mansion, none of
them appear to have been used within the last several years.  Everything
is cobweb-covered.</LongDescription>
