  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of another hallway in the caverns below the
glacier.  One hallway heads west while the other heads north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It has gotten rather dark as you have passed into the rocky surface
below the great ice glacier.  The sun can no longer illuminate your path

north and south, intersecting another hallway, which heads west.</LongDescription>
