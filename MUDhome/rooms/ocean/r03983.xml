  <ShortDescription>You are inside a hollow redwood, which is known as Trantori's.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a small ledge here, just big enough to stand on.  The ladder rungs
continue above and below you.    A small group of knotholes nearby allow 
light to enter, but not enough to see any detail in here. The ledge seems 
to get wider on the northern side of the tree.</LongDescription>
