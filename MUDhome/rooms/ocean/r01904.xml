  <ShortDescription>You are in the Oceancrest Central Arena's Warm-up Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Warm-Up Arena is designed to prepare combatants for the thrills 
and excitement which awaits them to the south in the Knight's Honor
Arena and the Gladiator's Pits.  There's not much of a crowd watching
you here as they're all down further south where all the excitement
and killing is.  There does seem to be quite a bit of blood on the
ground, though.</LongDescription>
