  <ShortDescription>You are in an old aquaduct, near a locked grate where the water disappears.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stream gurgles and runs through the ancient iron grate, swirling
away out of sight.  This must be at a point somewhere underneath the
ruined temple in the jungle above.  The brickwork lining the old tunnel
is crumbled and in a heap here, almost like it had been destroyed by
an earthquake.  If you don't have a key to the grate the only exit from
here is to the northwest.</LongDescription>
