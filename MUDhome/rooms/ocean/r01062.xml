  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, west of the Oceancrest Ministry of Order.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ministry of Order is charged by the crown with the responsibility of
maintaining peace in the city.  They have the largest taxpayer supported
budget of all the ministries.  Actually, to call it a Ministry of Order is
sort of an oxymoron.  It's more like a maze of beauracracy.  The Ministry
is in charge of the Oceancrest Detention and Rehabilitation Facility, and
most people know that once you enter there, even if you are just visiting,
you will probably never be seen again.  The rule is that any paper inside
there must be signed in triplicate by four different department heads before
it is valid.  Most papers also require the signature of the Mayor, but he
has been dead for three years now.</LongDescription>
