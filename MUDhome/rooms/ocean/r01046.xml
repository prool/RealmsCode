  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, towards the center of the shopping district.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are in the primary shopping district for the southwestern portion of
Oceancrest.  It is not the largest shopping district, but by far the
most exclusive and expensive.  The shops here cater to the discriminating
shopper, not to the bums on the street.  To the west, there is a large
building.  One of the signs on the door reads "Batton Locks &amp; Picks".
There is another door on both the east and west sides of the street to
the south.</LongDescription>
