  <Name>Temple Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret passage deep inside the Uland Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a peep hole on the north wall of the passage.  Looking through
it will reveal the main chamber of the temple, with the altar directly to
the north.  On the south side of the passage there used to be an opening
which is now blocked by a fallen stone.  Looks like it allowed light from
outside to fall on the altar, but for what purpose?</LongDescription>
