  <ShortDescription>The crushed gravel path leads east and west through the Walk of Heroes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walk is impressive with its great monuments to the north and south.
To the northeast the Sage's Rest comes into view, a monument somewhat
strangely erected to the illusionist Zelinx.  it is rumored that he
buried himself with his tower, but most people are too scared to go
in and see for themselves.</LongDescription>
