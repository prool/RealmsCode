  <Name>Forest Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a glass smooth tunnel far below the floor of the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel is a remarkable piece of work, although it's apparent nothing
living could produce such incredibly smooth walls.   It looks as if a
giant fireball roared through here, and the earth melted.</LongDescription>
