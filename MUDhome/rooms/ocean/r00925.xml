  <LongDescription>The Elven Training Grounds is a place to go to practice your skills 
against the best warriors.  To the southeast are the hand-to-hand
combat areas where elves fight each other (usually to settle disputes).
To the southwest are the dragon combat areas.  The elves would like
to eventually reclaim their city from the dragons and have managed
to cature a number of them to practice their fighting skills on.  </LongDescription>
