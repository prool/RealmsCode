  <ShortDescription>Marina Way continues to the north and south.  An alley is to the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the west side of the street is the Leviathan Small Boat Rental offfice.
Many people in the city of Oceancrest believe the business is just a front
for a gang of retired pirates, now in the smuggling trade, but since they
always pay their taxes and goods can be purchased in there for a fraction
of their true costs, no one ever complains.  Small shops are to the east.</LongDescription>
