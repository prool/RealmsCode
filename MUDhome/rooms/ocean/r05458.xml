  <ShortDescription>You are on a steep climbing road, high in the Hafnia Mountains.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On one side of you is a sheer drop, while the other side is a steep cliff.
It would be impossible to leave the road at this point, unless you could
fly.  There are clouds hanging over the valley which you could almost touch
if you would just lean out over the edge of the road.</LongDescription>
