  <Name>Trokkawilff's Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in an eerie tunnel named after a long dead master torturer.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Legend tells of the master torturer Thokkawilff who would flay his prisoners
to the point where they were barely alive but conscious, and then roast
and eat strips of their flesh in front of them.  Thokkawilff preferred to
live down here, below the great castle, so he could be close to his work.
Because he once did a secret favor for a powerful dark mage, some say his
shade still resides in his chambers.  The shimmering darkness is a portal
which leads to those chambers.</LongDescription>
