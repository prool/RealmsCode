  <ShortDescription>You are in a dimly lit room which appears to be stained throughout by blood.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This huge room appears limitless in space, with dark shadows as the only
visible boundaries.  However, a faint noise which resembles the clicking
of keyboards seems to incessantly extend itself from the darkness.  In
what appears to be the center of the room, Harikari, master of the
occult and technology, is seen manipulating a microcosmic representation 
of Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
