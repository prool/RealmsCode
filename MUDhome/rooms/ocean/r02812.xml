  <ShortDescription>You are in the middle of a long hallway running north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The long hallway extends out to the north and south as far as you can
see, even in the darkness.  There is a small hallway to the east which
appears to connect this and another, longer hallway further to the east.
The dark tunnels are still strangely quiet and tranquil; an obvious sign
that something is amiss.</LongDescription>
