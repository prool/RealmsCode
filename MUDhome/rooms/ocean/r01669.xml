  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Appleton Road, east of the Farmer's Residences.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Small, individual houses, a rarity in Oceancrest, lie on the west side of
the diagonally running road.  These houses are provided for by the city
for the numerous farmers that live in the area and work the fields.  
Although there is not really a lack of regular housing in the city, the
residences are quite a distance from the fields.</LongDescription>
