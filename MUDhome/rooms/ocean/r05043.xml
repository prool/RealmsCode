  <ShortDescription>You are on the back of a copper dragon in light clouds.  50.n3.e3.s0.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east is a sparkling river which flows to the south across the vast
Gotland Glenn.  There are light clouds in that direction, and if you don't
want to get lost in them, you could turn away, or perhaps fly higher.  To
the north there is a dark mountain range.</LongDescription>
