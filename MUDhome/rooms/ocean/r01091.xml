  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Hafnia Way, just east of a noisy encampment.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several large and colorful tents are to the east, and bright banners, flags
and pennants fly above them.  There are a couple hundred people there, and
many camels and horses.  The Oceancrest merchants are putting together a
caravan to take supplies to surrounding cities.  They hope to return with
a handsome profit, and perhaps some exotic goods they can sell here for 
even more gold.  They're a greedy bunch.</LongDescription>
