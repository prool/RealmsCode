  <Name>The Animal Wagon</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the wagon where most of of the predatory animals are kept. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wagon is full of cages which are occasionaly left open and may cause
danger to people who are not guided by a trainer.  You see different kinds
of tigers, lion, bears and elephants around.  Most of them are not pleased 
with their living conditions and may try to lash out at you.  The view and
the air here are not too pleasent, and even the trainers, themselves, try
not to come here, as long as possible.  You can hardly make your way
through the dung and bones which cover the floor.</LongDescription>
