  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Taragon Road near a boarded up old house.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a ladder leaning against the village wall and it looks as though you
could make it to the top easily.  Why anyone other than the militia might
want to do that is another matter.   Taragon Road continues to the north
and south from here.  A trickle of sewage disappears into a street drain.</LongDescription>
