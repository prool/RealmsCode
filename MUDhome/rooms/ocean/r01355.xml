  <LongDescription>The North Oceancrest Ministries are located on the north part of the
street, providing order and wisdom for the city.  The Ministry of Rumor
Control is one of the more interesting bodies in city politics, and is
responsible for detailed information about events which happen in the
city.  This is kind of like the media, except slightly better.</LongDescription>
