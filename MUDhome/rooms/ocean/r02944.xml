  <Name>Jactac's Home in the Trees</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a large bird house hanging in the trees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have to stoop to avoid the ceiling, but other than that the place is
rather large and airy.  It's a little dirty, however.  There are piles of
trash in every corner, and even the remains of a dead mouse.  Odd trinkets
are scattered in the room, and a broken mirror hangs from a string in the
center of the room.  This is the home of Jactac, the largest and wisest
old raven in the enchanted forest.</LongDescription>
