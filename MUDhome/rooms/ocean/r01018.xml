  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner where Main Street heads off to the east and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street turns to the south or east, depending on which direction you're
facing at the time.  Directly north are the long docks of Nylandian Bay,
although you cannot get there from this spot.  The picturesque, rocky coast
provides fishermen with excellent sport and income, but is also a little
dangerous.  Several people have mysteriously disappeared while strolling or
fishing there.  The Notoriously run Grinning Sailor Pub is southeast. 
It seems to be a hangout for sailors returning from long voyages.</LongDescription>
