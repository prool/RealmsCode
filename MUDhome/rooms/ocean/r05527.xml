  <ShortDescription>This is the Nyyron Trail, which traverses the mountains going south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trail is almost overgrown now, but wagon ruts still show the way along
the rocky outcroppings.  Further south is one of the old signal watch towers
which used to be used by the militia to warn the cities when there might
be danger of invasion.</LongDescription>
