  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the Barbarian Pits, on the Ramdes Bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This bridge is really nothing more than a few old ropes tied together. 
Beneath you are the dark waters of the famous Ramdes River, whose source  
has never been explored because no one can find the headwaters.  You would
think that all one would have to do is follow the river, but looking north
you see it comes down from the mountains through a very deep, foggy valley.
That terrain looks forboding.</LongDescription>
