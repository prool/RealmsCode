  <ShortDescription>You are on a muddy path beside a pond in the enchanted forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the pond is rather shallow here, but appears to get deeper toward the north.
trees grow in the water, and moss hangs from everything.  The path is not
well defined, and the mud is rather slippery.  It's kinda gloomy, don't
you think?  An owl hoots in the distance, and there's some noise you can't
identify closer by.</LongDescription>
