  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, north of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dentra Central Archery Range is located on the north side of the road.
Unfortunately, you are standing behind the targets.  However, since the
range you are standing behind is for advanced archers, it is unlikely that
they will miss their targets.  On the south side of the road, you can see
the City Walls as they merge into the South Oceancrest Observational
Station.</LongDescription>
