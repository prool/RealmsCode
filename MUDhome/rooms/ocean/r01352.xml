  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Neilian Drive, north of the Temple of Harmonic Discord.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Temple of Harmonic Discord is a strange cult of hypocrits who somehow
think that if there's a problem, there's a peaceful way around it.  This
is never true because no one ever wants to give up what they have "for
the better good".  Nevertheless, they keep trying.</LongDescription>
