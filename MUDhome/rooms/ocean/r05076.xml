  <ShortDescription>You are in the saddle of a great copper dragon.  70.n0.e23.s7.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The beautiful Kista Forest spreads out below you, stretching for as far
as you can see.  In the skies to the east, you occasionally catch a glimpse
of a copper flash in the clouds.  There are other riders in the air, but
wild copper dragons also inhabit this area.</LongDescription>
