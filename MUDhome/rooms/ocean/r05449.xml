  <ShortDescription>This is the west end of Hafnia Gorge, a deep cut formed by the Ashton River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the road is on a ledge, high on the southern face of the mountain with a
cold rock face beside you.  As you look overhead, you see twin castles built
opposite each other on opposing sides of the gorge.  Far below is the mighty
Ashton river, looking like a blue line from this height.</LongDescription>
