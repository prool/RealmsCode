  <ShortDescription>You are in a cell of the Oceancrest Detention and Rehabilitation Center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are buried hundreds of meters below ground level in a cell quarried
out of grey marble.  The only opening you can find is a narrow slit,
barely large enough to put your hand in, which lets light and air come
from the surface down a tiny shaft.  The walls are smooth and seamless
with no exit.  Although Oceancrest prides itself on the name of this
institution, do not be deceived.  Prisoners in this cell are never
rehabilitated and must spend the rest of their life (and then some) in
this small room.  You will never again be a part of society, but you may 
send or receive mail.</LongDescription>
