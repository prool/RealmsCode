  <ShortDescription>You are on Brownhaven Way, one of the more respectable throughfares.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not far to the south you can see the entrance to a village concert hall.
The people of Brownhaven pride themselves on their understanding of
culture, and try to attend most of the recitals given here.  Unfortunately,
they often have good excuses for not attending, so generally only a few
patrons can be found at any particular evening.  But if you are really
looking for a good time, the Boar's Tit Pub is popular every night.</LongDescription>
