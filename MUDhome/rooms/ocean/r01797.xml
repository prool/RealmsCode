  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Hillcrest Drive, just north of the Melbourne Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Melbourne Arena is by far the most interesting building in the area,
but you can also see a number of small shops and other stores to the east.
On the north side of the road, you can see the building which houses the
Order of the White Rose, where young knights aspiring to be Paladins of 
the King go to get their basic training.</LongDescription>
