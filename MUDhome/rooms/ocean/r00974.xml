  <Name>The Widow Maker - Crew's Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the crew's quarters below the deck of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Seeing how most pirates don't really have that much for themselves in the
first place, they probably don't really like you lounging around in their
private quarters while they're on duty.  You're likely to find some
resistance if you are determined to stay in here.</LongDescription>
