  <ShortDescription>You are in a small tunnel where you must crawl to travel through it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel seems to get taller in the northwest direction, but that is also
the descending direction of the tunnel.  The floor is steeply slanted in
that way.  Water drips continually from the low ceiling, and a steady but
small stream is in the center of the floor, moving rapidly northwest.</LongDescription>
