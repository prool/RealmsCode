  <ShortDescription>You are in a massive stone tunnel, known as the Knight's Walk.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel continues to the east and west, gradually rising toward the
east.  Further to the west the Knight's Walk ends, but a hallway appears
to continue to the south from there.  The stone wall is cold to the touch
on both sides of you, and a cool breeze whistles around you.  Graffitti
covers the north wall.</LongDescription>
