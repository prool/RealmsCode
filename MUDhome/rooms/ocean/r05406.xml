  <ShortDescription>You are on Forest Road, which runs south to Lyanden Road, and north to
the ancient burial grounds of imps, gnomes and leprachauns.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small stream is flowing across the road, and a footbridge crosses
over it.  A sign is on the other side, but you cannot read it from here.
You can hear an odd noise underneath the wooden structure, sort of a
snapping sound.  A good forest path is to the northeast.</LongDescription>
