  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, east of the Uland Repair Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Uland is the name of a small island off the coast of the Respitial Sea,
about twenty miles or so south of Oceancrest.  Why the proprietor decided
to name his shop after this small island is still a mystery to most
people.  The repair shop will fix almost any weapon or armor for a small
amount of gold, depending on how much the item in question is worth.</LongDescription>
