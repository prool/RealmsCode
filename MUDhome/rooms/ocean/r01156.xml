  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, just south of Khelleva Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large plaza circle you see to the north is called Khelleva Circle
because it connects three major roads which run east directly into
the Khelleva Estate.  The large traffic circle was in fact built by
the Khelleva Family just as a show of wealth and commitment to the
city that they live in.  The Oceancrest Central Arena is located to the
west, where you can hear loud cries of both victory and agony.</LongDescription>
