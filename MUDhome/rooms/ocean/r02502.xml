  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow little street known as Commerce Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several small shops are crowded along both the east and west side of this
shopping district.  Although the street is small, there are a number of 
shoppers going in and out of the business places.  Some of these shops are
famous even in Oceancrest.  Tiamat Lane is the street you see to the north, 
where you also see the doors of the Great Observatory.</LongDescription>
