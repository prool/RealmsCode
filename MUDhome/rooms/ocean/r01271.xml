  <ShortDescription>You are in the great tomb of Deneb, founding mage of Keslar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This tomb is huge and covered with gold and jewels.  Deneb formed a group
of mages that met at Keslar Palace centuries ago to practice magic taught
to him by the elves.  Deneb was the first recorded human to master the
art of magic.  The elves never trusted humans with their magic for fear
of what would happen if it got into the wrong hands.</LongDescription>
