  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, north of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large city walls seem to dwarf you in size, especially if you are a
dwarf.  They rise nearly twenty feet high at some points, especially on
the south side.  The Southern Entrance to the city is located to the west
of here off of Main Street.  Although leaving the city is easy, it isn't
always as simple to get back in.</LongDescription>
