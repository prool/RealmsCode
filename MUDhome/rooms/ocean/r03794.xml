  <ShortDescription>You are between high sand dunes on the south side of Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are north of the bay, and looking further north you see the beginning
of a high cliff that gets higher as it reaches into the waters to the west.
There are a number of both large and small caves on the cliff side, and
it looks like they might be interconnected inside.  A little bit to the
north is a path leading to the top of the cliffs.  The waters of the bay
lie to the south.</LongDescription>
