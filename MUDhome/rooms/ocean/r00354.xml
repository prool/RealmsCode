  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Rum Road South, the best road on the entire island.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Pink Lady bar and grill is on the west side of the road.  Some kind
of a disturbance seems to be taking place in there.  Next door is a small
place called the Green Goat, but it seems to be popular only with dwarves.
Further to the south you can see a huge wooden building that must be the
distillery.  It seems to have a tin roof, and a ramshackle loading dock.</LongDescription>
