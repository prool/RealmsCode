  <ShortDescription>You are in a cold and damp annex to the cellar of the Oceancrest Orphanage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This seems to be the dirtiest living quarters you have ever seen.  It's also
cramped and cold in here, but it's obvious that someone live in this place.
The children in the orphanage upstairs believe Miculash,  the caretaker of
the place, turns bad kids into soap.  They tell visitors that he slits
their throats, lets them bleed dry, then renders their bodies in a huge
vat of lye and ash to make soap.  Of course no one believes such wild tales.</LongDescription>
