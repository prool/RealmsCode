  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to DeNail's Prized Corn Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>DeNail is always looking for young, strong people that he doesn't have
to pay to do his work.  Therefore, he only lets unskilled labor into 
his ranch.  The large corn fields are immense, spanning to the west
as far as the eye can see.  The talk corn stalks prevent you from 
seeing very far in any one direction.  There sure is a lot of corn here.</LongDescription>
