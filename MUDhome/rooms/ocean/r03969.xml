  <ShortDescription>You are standing outside the home of Llanandar, the elven bowmaker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The giant old oak has doors and windows cut in the living tree, and an 
old elf can be seen working inside.  Another old elf appears to be asleep 
by the door.  A small sign, with a cursive script, proclaims this to be a
bowyer's workshop.  The creek runs along the side, and you see a small
bridge over it, and a path which goes deeper into the woods.</LongDescription>
