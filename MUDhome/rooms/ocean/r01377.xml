  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark, secret hallway that no one seems to know about.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The musty hallway continues to the north.  At the south, it turns
sharply to the west.  Although it's very dark in here, you have a
strange feeling that something is not right in here or that something
bad is going to happen.</LongDescription>
