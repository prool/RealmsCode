  <Name>Lyanden Road</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are traveling east/west on Lyanden Road, just east of Forest Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north and east you see a forbidding mountain range in the distance
and occasionally feel a chill gust of wind that came down off the snow-
covered peaks.  Rumors speak of a race of giants who live there, and of
course there are the mountain trolls.  The Enchanted Forest is north of you.</LongDescription>
