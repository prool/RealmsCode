  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Orchard Lane, north of Oolan's Armory Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oolan's Armory specializes in unique and interesting armors that may 
not be common in other parts of town.  Most of these armors are not out
of the ordinary, but usually tend to last longer than conventional 
leather or chain armors.</LongDescription>
