  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark tunnel deep below the hermit's cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The floor is slick with a slimy liquid which is probably a
mixture of mud and mildew.  Now, the only noise which can be
heard is the melodic dripping of water.  All signs of reptilian
life has disappeared as you enter this section of the tunnel.</LongDescription>
