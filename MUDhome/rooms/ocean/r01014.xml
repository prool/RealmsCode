  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, near the primary shipyards of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Darby Reynolds builds any size ship for any person with the correct
amount of gold.  His ships are said to be works of art; most of them
are still sailing the many oceans.  Darby's Shipyard Office is on the
west side of Main Street.  Heading North, you can now see the blue-
green water of Nylandian Bay.  On the east, there is a shop with a 
large banner which reads "Empirial Flags".  The banner is ornately
stitched with the finest silks.</LongDescription>
