  <ShortDescription>You are east of the intersection of Nathan Drive and Brownhaven Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road is an old church, which used to belong to
a hobbitish congregation, but was abandoned when a group of screaming ghosts
invaded it from the cemetery next door.  The church door hangs open, and
no one has ever had the courage to nail it shut.   Nathan Drive runs to
the east and west from here.</LongDescription>
