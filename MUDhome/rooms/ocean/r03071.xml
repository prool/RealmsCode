  <ShortDescription>This is a secret passage that was used by the Ulandian Priests long ago.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a series of doors along here, probably going to apartments for
the priests, but the destruction has long since blocked easy access to them.
The passage continues to twist and turn, and seems to go both northwest and
east from this point.</LongDescription>
