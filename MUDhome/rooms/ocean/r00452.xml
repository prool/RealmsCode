  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Hofton Avenue, between north of the Evenborough Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Travelers coming in from the north side of the town often stop at the
Evenborough Inn before heading into town, assuring them of a good place to
stay the night.  It is a very long walk to the southern side of town, where
the rest of the Inns are located, although there are a couple near the
marina.  The Evenborough Inn is also ideal for visitors to Lyanden Castle,
which lies to the east of the Inn.</LongDescription>
