  <ShortDescription>The Melbourne Pawn Shop will buy just about anything you have to offer.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Fencing is not taken lightly in Oceancrest, so most of the pawn shops
in the city won't be visible from the street.  In fact, most pawn shops
are in fact thieves' guilds that are more than happy to make a little
extra gold off of some poor, unsuspecting sap.</LongDescription>
