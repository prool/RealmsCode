  <ShortDescription>You are stuck in the strange, mysterious fog that is denser than Iibin's
Tavern Pea Soup (which you could really use right now as exploration of
this strange place has tired you out.  You still can't make out exactly 
where you are heading.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>After some experimentation, you manage to find the slick green walls, that
almost feel slimy.  By following the walls, you can more or less find 
your way through this wierd maze of sorts.</LongDescription>
