  <ShortDescription>You are in a small room with many beds and jars of herbs nearby.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>No doubt this must be some sort of healing room.  The smell of the air
suggests that something is perhaps amiss.  The odor is horrible, but you
seem to be getting stronger or at least feel rejuvenated.  This must be
where the King's elite knights come after a long and drawn battle.</LongDescription>
