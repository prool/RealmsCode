  <ShortDescription>Poor Alley runs to the north from here, and Plasnelt Road goes east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A fighting academy is located on the north side, near the entrance to the
alley.  The only way many of the kids who grow up in this section of the
village can ever escape poverty is to fight their way out, and perhaps be
hired by some rich family to serve as a bodyguard.  The academy helps to
train many of them.</LongDescription>
