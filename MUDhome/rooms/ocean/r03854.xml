  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow, winding alley just east of Eidenhoft Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A number of speciality shops are here in the alley, and there is a lot of
foot traffic going between the narrow walkway and Eidenhoft Boulevard to
the east.  A story you overheard in the Dragon Claw makes you think this
is the alley where a school for pickpockets is located.  Hold on to your
wallet as you walk through here.  On the south side of the alley is a narrow
doorway leading to the headquarters of a mercernary group.</LongDescription>
