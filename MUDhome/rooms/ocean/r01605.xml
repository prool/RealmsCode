  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, east of the Allisk Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It has been long rumored that Natasha de Allisk was indeed a vampire, 
and that she comes out some nights when the weather is just right to
pick up little children and take then away to drink their blood.  At
least, this is what parents like to tell their children who stay out
late at night, regardless of what their parents say.</LongDescription>
