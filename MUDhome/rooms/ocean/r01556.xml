  <Name>Outer Circle of Etolos</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along the outskirts of the forest of Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees in this forest seem to create a path that you can follow 
around Etolos.  To the northeast, you can see one of the inner circles.
Strangely enough, you don't see a lot of physical structures in the
forest.  The population of druids, however, seems to increase the further
east you head.</LongDescription>
