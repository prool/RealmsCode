  <ShortDescription>You are surrounded by wild colored moving plants and vines.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a narrow path through here, and it looks like it has been maintained
by someone.  You see pieces of vegetation that have been hacked and left
on the trail, clearing a way to the east and northwest.  The brilliantly
colored plants seem to reach out for you.</LongDescription>
