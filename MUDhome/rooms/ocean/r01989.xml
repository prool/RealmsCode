  <Name>Path To The Manor</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a lightly paved path that appears to head towards the Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are two paths here.  The larger brick-laid one heads west towards the
Manor, while the smaller and less traveled one goes to the southern side of
the estate.  Absolutely nothing appears to be growing anywhere, and the
atmosphere is all together creepy.  Some say they can hear wolves howling
into the night when the moon is full, but it's kinda silent right now.</LongDescription>
