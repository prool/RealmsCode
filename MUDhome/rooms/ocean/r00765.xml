  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceancrest Avenue, between the park and the Crimson Dragon Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The posh Crimson Dragon Traveler's Lodge on the south side of the road
is a very popular lodging place for visitors to Oceancrest.  Its luxurious
accomodations are not without a price, though.  On the north side of the
road is the Wakarimasu Park, an elegant park based on ancient oriental
architectures.</LongDescription>
