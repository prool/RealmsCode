  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along the outer fringe of the wasteland known as Avernus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The various craters and rocks scattered about by angry devils and demons
who have nothing better to do, is a show of their awesome powers over
their world.  Those who would dare to challenge them would surely perish.
Each level of Hell has its own guardian, who protects the level below it.
In order to proceed down the planes of hell, you must defeat these powerful
guardians.</LongDescription>
