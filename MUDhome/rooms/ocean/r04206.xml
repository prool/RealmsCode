  <ShortDescription>This is the entry to the Castle Rutger's main courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>directly west is the castle's gates through a great stone archway.  The main
courtyard opens up to the east.  Over to the north you can see a tier of 
seats and a group of noblemen and ladies in colorful silks.  Evidently the
seats are for spectators of the troop assembly which takes place twice a 
day.  Several knights in black armor and silver helmets are already here.</LongDescription>
