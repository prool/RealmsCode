  <ShortDescription>You are in a wide alley which goes east and west behind Hafnia's best shops.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is an entry, or exit depending on your point of view, to the west.
The south side of the alley seems to be a series of locked doors, but on
the north side you see several municipal offices and warehouses.  This
alley is not very clean.  You would think the city would be embarrassed.</LongDescription>
