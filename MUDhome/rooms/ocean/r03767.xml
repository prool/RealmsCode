  <Name>Mortuary Cellar Stairs</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the stairs leading to the cellar of the mortuary.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stairs lead between the main floor of the mortuary and the cold
storage room below.  When the dead are brought here, they often spend
a day or more down below while the next of kin are notified.  The Davis
Brother Mortuary is one of the busiest places of business in all of
Oceancrest.  Seems like people die constantly.  If you wait just a 
moment, you may become aware of another death as you stand here.</LongDescription>
