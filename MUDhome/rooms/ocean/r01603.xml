  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, south of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Overland Drive takes a funny turn towards the southeast here.  The
Necropolis continues along the north side of the road, even past the
turn.  You can now see the large Manor of Natasha de Allisk to the
south.  There are two large gates located to the southeast of here
that appear to lead into the Manor.</LongDescription>
