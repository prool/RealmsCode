  <ShortDescription>You are on a tight turn on the road, and its hard to see very far.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Above you is an overhanging cliff, providing you with some degree of
protection from the cold wind and occasional snow flakes.  The wind seems
to be particulary violent as it comes howling from the east, down from the
mountain.  Mountain trolls are said to enjoy such weather.</LongDescription>
