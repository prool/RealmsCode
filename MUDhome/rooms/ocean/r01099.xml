  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along Nagaritha Drive, just east of a large intersection.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Natasha's stables are located in the sliver of land created by the
strangely shaped Eidenhoft Boulevard, which runs northeast to southwest.
South of Nagaritha Drive is a small shop.  The sign above the door
reads "Bysantal's General Goods and Services" in proud, bold lettering.
Oceanview Drive is just west of here.</LongDescription>
