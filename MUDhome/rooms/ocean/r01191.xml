  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, just north of the Weapons Plaza.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evander's World of Weapons boasts the largest selection of the best weapons
money can buy.  There are separate shops for polearms, armors and swords.
Evander doesn't really cater to bows and missile weapons because the elves
make much better products.  The entrance to the center is located to the
south.  Evander also buys used weapons to recycle into new ones.</LongDescription>
