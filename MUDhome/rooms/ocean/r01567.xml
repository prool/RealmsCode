  <Name>Middle Circle of Etolos</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the middle circle path around the Etolos complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Despite the primative nature of the druids, you sense that they are
actually more civilized than the modern townsperson.  The peace and
tranquility are resounded in the atmosphere of group participation and
cooperation.  Outsiders have mocked the Etolian Druids because of these
primative attitudes, but in fact, they have survived longer than any
other human civilization in the world.</LongDescription>
