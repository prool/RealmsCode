  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Main Street, which runs north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A rather nice shop lies in the building to the east of Main Street.  
The sign above the door reads "Rosyln's Ornate Wood Carvings".  The
entrance to the small shop is decorated in fancy wood totempoles and
other strange carvings you're not really familiar with.  To the west
is the large City Guard Barracks, which is not necessarily the best
place for a criminal to be standing around.  </LongDescription>
