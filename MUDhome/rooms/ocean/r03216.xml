  <ShortDescription>You are very near the shore of Lake Kista which lies to the southwest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look out across this beautiful lake, you catch a glimpse of
something, or someone, playing in the waters and bathing in the sun.
Since you are caught by the beauty of the lake, you should consider a 
relaxing swim.  Just ignore those tales you heard about monsters.</LongDescription>
