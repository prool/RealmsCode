  <Name>Sunken Pirate Ship</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the starboard gun deck of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nearby are a line of heavy brass cannons, neatly shoved into place with
block and tackle.  Stacked in pyramids you see the iron balls and metal
shards used to cut through the rigging of the Snap Dragon's prey.  Until
this ship went down, it was the most feared pirate ship in existance.
There is a rumor that much of the booty and treasure is buried somewhere
near this bay.  But then, only a fool believes rumors.</LongDescription>
