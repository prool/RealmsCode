  <LongDescription>The Amphitheatre entrance lies to the north of Nagaritha Drive.  It is
composed primarily of grass, with a little bit of boxed seating towards
the front of the theater near the stage.  As dusk approaches, more and 
more people begin to arrive.  There is a large building on the south side
of the road which has a sign that reads "Dangerous Destinations: Guide
to the Universe".  The entrance to this building appears to be to the 
west.</LongDescription>
