  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Eidenhoft Boulevard and Netherworld Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Netherworld Lane crosses Eidenhoft Boulevard in an east to west direction.
The wide street gets its name because it passes on the north side of the
Necropolis, an eerie "City for the Dead."  Eidenhoft Boulevard continues to
the north and south, bisecting most of the city.  </LongDescription>
