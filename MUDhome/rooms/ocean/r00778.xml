jacinith hallway going east to west and the ruby hallway extending to
the north.  There is a small stairwell to the south that leads down.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small sign above the staircase says "Crystal Alcove".  As you peer
down the staircase, you can see your reflection, as if you were waiting
at the bottom of the staircase looking up.  A cool breeze can be felt
coming from the bottom of the stairwell.</LongDescription>
