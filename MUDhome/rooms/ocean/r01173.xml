  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, just west of Eidenhoft Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of Netherworld Lane, you can see the back side of a
small shopping complex.  The entrance to the complex is probably on the
other side of the building.  To the south, there is a large building
with a moderate-sized gem hovering about it.  When the sun hits the gem,
it radiates a brilliant purple glow over the entire building and some of
the adjacent streets.</LongDescription>
