  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Bendine Way, east of the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Cathedral of Worldly Bliss is the center of all clerical bodies in 
Oceancrest, and much of the outlying lands.  All the clerics usually come
here to discuss the various problems with the society and find remedies
to fix them.  It is a well known notion that mankind cannot think for
themselves, therefore they must have religion to create morality.</LongDescription>
