  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Waterfront Way, north of the Walking Yards.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Walking Yards and Stables are provided as a convenience 
to guests and vistors when they bring in steeds.  Although horses are
allowed on the street, this tends to be very dangerous as they do tend
to scare easily.  The Stables and Walking Yards provide a safe and 
protective environment for your trusty steed.</LongDescription>
