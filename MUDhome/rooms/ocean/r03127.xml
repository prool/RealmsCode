  <ShortDescription>You are in the liquor locker cellar of the Grinning Sailor Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly below you is a disposal pit where bodies and other garbage is 
thrown.  Although dark, you can see a shuffling movement down there.
As a matter of fact, the entire cellar is dark.  Over near the west wall 
is a small table with but a single candle on it.  Most of the space is   
taken up by great kegs of ale and rum.</LongDescription>
