  <Name>Secret Quick Car Transporter</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the quick car station for the town of Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The quick cars are a fast and efficient mode of transportation between
different places in the mountains and valleys.  The elves of Caledonia
created these cars and passages to travel great distances in minimal
amounts of time.  Brownhaven is about as far west as these cars go.
At one point, the elves held a fascination with the humans, but 
decided that their basic nature was too violent to peacefully coexist
together.</LongDescription>
