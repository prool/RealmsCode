  <LongDescription>The mysterious tree which grows inside the Allakaren Circle is said to
have existed long before any humans had inhabitted the area now known as
Oceancrest, and could have been the product of the elves.  Nevertheless,
the Pharaoh Allakaren adopted the long-living tree as his own and gave
the blood of his wives as a sacrifice to the tree.  It is also believed
that the blood of Allakaren also runs through the roots of the tree.</LongDescription>
