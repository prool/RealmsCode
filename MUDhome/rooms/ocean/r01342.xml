  <ShortDescription>You are in an alley behind Thernardier's Inn and leading to the stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Highland Stables is a rather nice place to board your horse, and they
also rent horses to travellers coming out of the city.  It really is an
honest mistake when they rent your horse to some drunken lout who doesn't
know how to treat a horse.  The alley connects to Wakeforest Drive on the
west.</LongDescription>
