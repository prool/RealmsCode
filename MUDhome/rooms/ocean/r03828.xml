  <Name>Ferocious Beast Cage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have found yourself inside the displacer beast's cage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In the corner of the cage is a small bit of straw being used as a bed for
the beast that is kept here.  Outside of the cage you can see tigers and
their tamers performing tricks.  Fortunately, none of those tigers can get
in here.  Unfortunately, the beast that resides in this cage is far more
deadly.  At first, displacer beasts, as they are called, look like panthers
with two tentacles springing out of their shoulders.  Closer examination
reveals a much more deadly trait.  As the beasts move, their bodies shift
dimensions, making them very difficult to focus on and hit.  Maybe there
is one stalking you right now...</LongDescription>
