  <Name>Grady's Second Hand Shop</Name>
  <ShortDescription>Our motto is, "we buy junk and sell antiques".  Show us what you have.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The shop is crowded with everything you can imagine, some of it hanging
from the ceiling.  There is a weapons display and a corner where you see
used magical items.  Grady drives a good bargain, but usually not for his
customers.  Grady is fair, however, and will give you at least what his
competitors offer.  Ask him the value of what you are offering.</LongDescription>
