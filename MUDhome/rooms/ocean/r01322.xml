  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, between the Rodaisal Community
Housing Complex on the west and the Iilandi University on the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Rodaisal Community Housing Complex provides simple, communal housing
for most of the population who choose to live within the city of 
Oceancrest.  Individual housing is impossible in the city due to the lack
of free space, so these large complexes were built to give people a
place to live.</LongDescription>
