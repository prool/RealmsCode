  <ShortDescription>You have wandered into a little used, and lesser known hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This hallway was probably just an access way to some area beyond the
main hallway before it was built.  It is now seldom used, as you can
see by the layers of dust and grime on the floors.  The hallway runs into
the main hall to the north.</LongDescription>
