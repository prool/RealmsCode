  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Regalia Drive, north of the Oceancrest Amphitheatre.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the Amphitheatre is to the south.  The large, grassy
hill provides space for thousands of people.  Some benches are set up
but most people are content to sit on the grass and discuss the day's
events, problems and other worries.  To the north is the Oceancrest
Ministry of Knowledge, where the collective knowledge of the town is
stored and guarded.</LongDescription>
