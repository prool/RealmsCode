  <ShortDescription>You are near the eastern end of Vallenda Pass.  50.n1.e0.s0.w3</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The pass is narrow a bit to the west, with a high bluff overlooking the
caravan trail.  There are large boulders atop the cliff, poised like huge
birds of prey.  They almost look like they were deliberately placed there.</LongDescription>
