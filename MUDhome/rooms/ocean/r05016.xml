  <ShortDescription>You are in open sky, north of Brownhaven.  65.n3.e0.s0.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From time to time there have been reports of a floating city, which may or 
may not be true.  As you scan the skies, you note there is seldom a long,
clear patch of open air, but instead there are lots of clouds everywhere.
If there is such a thing as a floating city, it could easily stay hidden.</LongDescription>
