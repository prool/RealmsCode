  <ShortDescription>You are on Overland Drive, west of the southern edge of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can make out the Allisk Manor to the west of here.  The entrance 
appears to be at the two large gates a little ways to the northwest.
On the northeast side of the road, you can see the southern borders
of the Necropolis.  The Necropolis is protected by a wall of iron
bars preventing people from entering the facility without going 
through the proper channels.</LongDescription>
