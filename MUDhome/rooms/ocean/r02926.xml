  <ShortDescription>You are near the northeastern citadel of the second plane of Hell, Dis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dis is almost like a city in itself, dominated by four large citadels at
each cardinal point of the compass.  At the center of everything is Dispater
himself, afterwhich this realm was named.  The powerful devil will do 
anything to prevent you from reaching him, including sending out some very
dangerous and deadly minions to destroy you.</LongDescription>
