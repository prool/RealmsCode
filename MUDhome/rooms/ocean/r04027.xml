  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the base of a frozen, hundred-meter waterfall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Around a particularly sharp corner of the trail the sparkling waterfall
comes into view.  It appears to be frozen in both time and space, and
the light falling on it creates a kaleidascope of shifting rainbows and
prismatic reflections.  Closer examination reveals that a section of the
waterfall is clearer, and slightly more transparent than the rest of it.
The trail apparently ends here.  Nice view.</LongDescription>
