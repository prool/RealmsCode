  <ShortDescription>You are in Michael O'Nalle's repair shop in the Waterfront Plaza.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>O'Nalle does a lot of work on swords and armors, but can fix just about
anything known to man and even a few things not known by man.  The 
price is fairly modest for simple items, but gets rather expensive for
exotic and enchanted items.  But some things are just irreplacible if
they're broken. </LongDescription>
