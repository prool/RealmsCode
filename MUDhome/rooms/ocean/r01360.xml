  <Name>Mountain Trail to the Palace</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the high mountain trail leading up to the Forbidden Palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trail up the mountains is starting to level out towards the summit.
Ahead to the south, you can see the great palace you saw from below. 
The "Forbidden" Palace, as many locals like to call it, seems very
desolate, but everyone seems to know that someone or something still
inhabits the old mansion. </LongDescription>
