  <Name>Desolate Corridor</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of a desolate corridor under the massive glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The quiet corridor looks like it hasn't been walked through for ages.  The
thick dust has been collecting for what appears to be centuries.  The
hallway continues to the north and the west.  You can hear some activity
brewing to the north, but you can't really see much, though.</LongDescription>
