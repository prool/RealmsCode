  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the type of weather that makes the weather wizards in Oceancrest
very happy.  It gives them a chance to watch their apprentices practice
their magic skills.  It also lets them do a little showing off to their
fellow wizards.  Anyway, you might expect the weather to change drastically
any minute now.  Maybe you ought to quit playing around and find land.</LongDescription>
