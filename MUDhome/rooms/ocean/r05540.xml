  <ShortDescription>You are several meters above the Nyyron trail, on the crest of an avalanch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>above you is a gulley where the avalanch debris came from.  It looks like
you could climb up there, if you have climbing gear with you.  Often gold
is discovered after a fresh avalanch, and this one only occurred since the
last winter.  Below you is the Nyyron Creek, where you see a small waterfall
has formed because of the newly deposited earth in the creek's path.</LongDescription>
