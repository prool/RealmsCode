  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking along the eastern rim of the Allisk Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the mysterious Allisk Manor on the northeast side of the 
circle, surrounded by metal bars.  The Manor is believed to still be
haunted by the ghosts of previous owners and even the notorious Countess
Natasha de Allisk herself.  Luckily, she hasn't been seen outside of 
her mansion so perhaps she has gone into hibernation.  Hillcrest Drive
continues off to the east.</LongDescription>
