  <ShortDescription>You are in one of the larger pubs located in the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A lot of different races seem to enjoy this pub.  You are in the main tap
room, and can see the pub also has a dining room in a separate part of
the building.  An oaken stairway on the south side of the room goes to an
upstairs section.  Looks like a couple of bouncers or guards are at the
bottom of the stairs.  Something interesting is up there, no doubt.</LongDescription>
