  <ShortDescription>You are a path through the necropolis, with a low building to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A chill mist seems to follow you as you move along the path, and is perhaps
getting a little thicker to the north.  The mist seems to envelope you,
making you shiver as you search through this place of the dead.  A voice
in the mist seems to whisper to you, "don't stray from the path, or you
might become a permanent resident with us."</LongDescription>
