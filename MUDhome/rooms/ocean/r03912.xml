  <ShortDescription>You have entered a bustling flea market owned by Nobunaga.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are several tents around you, and a number of sellers have open-air
tables set up.  Sellers and buyers crowd around, trying to get the best
bargains.  Nobunaga has a large tent to the south, and he takes a cut of
all the sales that happen here.  If you would like to trade or swap some
armor, or a nice weapon, you should contact Nobunaga the orc.</LongDescription>
