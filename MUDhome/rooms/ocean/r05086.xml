  <ShortDescription>You are in the kitchen dumbwaiter shaft.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evidently this was the means of delivering food to somewhere deep down in
the depths of the castle.  You might be able to go down there, but the shaft
is so small you could never do it with all of the equipment you have with
you.  There is a terrible stench coming from down there.</LongDescription>
