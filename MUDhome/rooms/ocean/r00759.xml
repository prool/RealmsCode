  <Name>Oceancrest Circle</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the western rim of the magnificent Oceancrest Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Walking around the Circle, you see that it is not just a dirt path, like
most of the other roads, but is finely decorated with ornate bricks and
cement.  Although there are a few paved roads in town, it is not common
to see such fancy artwork that people can step on.</LongDescription>
