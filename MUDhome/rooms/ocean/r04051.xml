  <Name>Phluebluts Pawn Shoppe</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a sleazy little pawn shop jammed full of junk.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Phluebluts himself stands behind the counter, quietly rubbing his hands as 
he waits for you to speak.  He is almost as wide as he is tall, which
doesn't really say much, considering how short he is.  Phluebluts is a
midget gnome, and is both lacivious and mercenary.</LongDescription>
