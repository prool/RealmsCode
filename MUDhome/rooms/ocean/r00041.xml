  <ShortDescription>Caledonia Road is a rather dismal area at this end of the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are several run-down old mansions set back away from the main part
of the road, and looking to the northeast, there appears to be one with
its windows completely boarded up.  A small post office can be seen on
the south side of the road.</LongDescription>
