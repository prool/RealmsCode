  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the crypt caverns.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The crypt caverns hold the remains of the deceased mages of Keslar.  These
'good' mages were banished with the coming of Kaylar and the crypts were
sealed forever.  Some say the ghosts of these mages still haunt the 
cavern crypts and will not rest until Keslar is released from evil.</LongDescription>
