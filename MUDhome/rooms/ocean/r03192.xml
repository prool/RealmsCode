  <Name>Pirate Bay Entrance</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the waters at the entrance to a well secluded bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The high cliff walls surrounding the pirate bay provide excellent
protection for ships which drop anchor here.  In past years, the private
nature of the bay made it an ideal hiding place for ships wishing to
avoid certain legal restrictions on trade.  It is rumored that this 
bay was often used by the most feared of all pirates, Captain Morgan.
This is the very bay where the Oceancrest Navy found Morgan one fateful
and fatal night.  There was a bloody battle, with no room to manuever 
for the pirates, and the Navy was able to sink Morgan's ship here.</LongDescription>
