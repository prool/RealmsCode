  <ShortDescription>You are on the main stage of the Kista Amphitheater.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The upper stage is rather impressive and the lower stage, designed for
larger performances requiring an orchestra, is also well constructed.  
The black floors make it almost impossible to see where you're stepping,
but you can see the audience seating to the south.  </LongDescription>
