  <ShortDescription>You are on a staircase which spirals around a huge redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>only the very tallest trees in the forest come to this height, and there are
not very many of them.  From the looks of the trunk of this redwood, there
could be a small village inside the tree, even at this height.  A small hole
in the tree at the base of a large branch seems dark and deep.</LongDescription>
