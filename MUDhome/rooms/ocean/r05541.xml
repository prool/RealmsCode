  <ShortDescription>You are at the western end of Glabor Gulley, near an avalanche's slide path. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east the gulley climbs out of sight into the towering mountains, and
the west it drops out of sight over the crest of the remains of a recent
avalanche.  There seems to be hundreds of small caves dug in the slopes of
the gulley, and it looks like a community area in the center of them.</LongDescription>
