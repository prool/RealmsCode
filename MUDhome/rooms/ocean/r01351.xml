  <ShortDescription>You are standing on Neilian Drive in front of the omnimous gates which
serve as the entrance to the ancient Dragon's Citadel, on the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large gate seems to be open as you approach the Citadel.  Many believe
that the Citadel has been long abandoned, but no one has really ventured
into the depths of the strange building.  The Dragon's Citadel awaits
those who dare to enter it.</LongDescription>
