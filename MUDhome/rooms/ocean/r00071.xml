  <ShortDescription>You are under the South Bridge, behind a wooden shack.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the shack is on the north side, but there appears to be
a back door here.  there are a lot of wine bottles lying on the ground
and the smell of urine and vomit is strong.  An old mattress is against
the bridge buttress, and a few dirty dishes are around a campfire.</LongDescription>
