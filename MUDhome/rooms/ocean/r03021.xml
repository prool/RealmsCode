  <ShortDescription>You are in a tunnel almost too tight to squeeze through.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>And it stinks too.  The tunnel does seem to be rather short, though, and
an exit can be seen at both ends.  There's a slime on the walls, and you
have just put your hands in something very squishy.</LongDescription>
