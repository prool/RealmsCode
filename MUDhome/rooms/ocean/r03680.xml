  <Name>Tower Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>A three-way split in the tunnel appears to be in the northwest direction.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nothing but darkness and an occasional scraping sound is in the oppoisite
direction.  There is also that constant sound of dripping water.  There are
some odd scratchings on the wall, and an arrow to the southeast, but it
was evidently put there a long time ago, and now it's unreadable.</LongDescription>
