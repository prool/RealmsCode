  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark storage room in the back of the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several years ago, when the previous owner of this inn was declared an
enemy of the crown, this building was confiscated and closed pending his
trial and subsequent execution.  At that time this room was locked, but
little did the workers know that a crazy old woman was in here when they
locked the door.  She couldn't possibly be here now, of course.</LongDescription>
