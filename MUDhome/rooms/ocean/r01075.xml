  <Name>Rosecrest/Eidenhoft/Waterfront Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the major intersection of Rosecrest, Eidenhoft and Waterfront.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This intersection brings together Rosecrest Street, which runs parallel
to the City Wall on the west, Eidenhoft Boulevard, which runs northeast
from here towards the Memorial Fountain and the center of town, and
Waterfront Way, a more rural path which heads towards the farms and 
grainery after it passes the shopping centers to the east.  This
intersection is not quite as busy as others because it runs along the
west City Wall.  It is however patroled regularly by the city guards.</LongDescription>
