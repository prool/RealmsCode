  <LongDescription>The City Guard Crime Patrol Headquarters is located to the north of 
Overland Drive.  Two large guards patrol the entrance and you can see
a number of city guards leave to patrol the streets.  The guards at
the front entrance are looking at you funny as you continue to stare
at them.  Main Street is to the east of here.  On the south side of the
street is the Dragon Tooth Inn, an exclusive inn for the discriminating
visitor.  The entrance is to the west.</LongDescription>
