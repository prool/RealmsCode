  <ShortDescription>You are on an east-west road running through the lush jungle on Rum Island.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road heads toward the sound of surf to the west, while to the east you
can see a group of ramshackle buildings and hear a lot of loud music and
laughter.  A crudely lettered sign nearby has an arrow pointing west, and
tells you the island cemetery is that way.  A human skull hangs from the
top of the sign, and it seems to still have eyes which glare at you.
A hasty hand has added to the sign, "Stay Away!  Voodoo!!"</LongDescription>
