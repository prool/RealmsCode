  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, north of the Allakaren Pyramid.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The impressive Allakaren Pyramid is almost directly to the south of you.
It has been said that the Pyramid is quite haunted, but that hasn't stopped
archeologists from exploring the caverns in great detail over the many
centuries the Pyramid has been standing.  No doubt looters have already
taken most of the valuables within the Pyramid.</LongDescription>
