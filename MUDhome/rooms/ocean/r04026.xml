  <Name>Golgoth Mountain Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You continue walking along the western side of the mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The air is thinner at this altitude, and very difficult to breath.  To make
matters worse, the path is even steeper along this section of the mountain.
At this height, and everywhere above, the path is perpetually covered with 
snow and ice, regardless of seasonal changes.</LongDescription>
