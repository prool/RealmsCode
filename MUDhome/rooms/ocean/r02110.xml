  <ShortDescription>You are standing beneath a golden apple tree, in front of Mehetable's hut.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tree rustles in the cool breeze, and you see a single, golden apple
sway on its branch near the center of the limbs.  The tree is in robust
health, and looks like it could produce golden apples for a good many years.</LongDescription>
