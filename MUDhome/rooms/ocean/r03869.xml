  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark and wet brick lined aquaduct, running east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The way is slippery and wet, and you have to be verey cautious as you move
along the tunnel.  Its also quite dark.  Hard to tell what you might find
down here.  Of course, nothing could live down here, right?  The water flow
is from west to east, so the water source must be further west.  This old  
waterduct was probably built by the ancient islanders who worshipped at the
ruined jungle temple located to the east.</LongDescription>
