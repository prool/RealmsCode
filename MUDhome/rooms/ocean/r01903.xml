  <ShortDescription>You are in the Oceancrest Central Arena Ready Room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Preparation Lounge is designed to be a locker room for the 
gladiators before they venture out into the arena.  To the east is
the Warm-Up Arena, where young gladiators and knights may challenge
you.  Further south is the Knight's Honor Arena.  Knights do not
initiate the fighting, but will fight a frightening battle once 
engaged.  To the south of the Ready Room is the One-on-One Combat
Arena.  Only one person may enter this arena at a time to battle
the lone gladiator in a one-on-one, hand-to-hand, to the death combat.</LongDescription>
