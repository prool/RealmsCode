  <ShortDescription>You are standing one step inside the Blaster's Bunker.  A sign nearby says
"KEEP OUT", and you better do so!</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have unwisely entered the Blaster's Bunker, where Gospodin, the 
Bulgarian Pyrotechnician, holds his dangerous experiments.  The bunker is
full of different tools, chemicals, flasks and elaborate glass tubework.
You see several kegs marked with skulls and crossed bones.  If you get
"lucky" you may witness an exclusive science experiment.  However, the
risk might be too great.</LongDescription>
