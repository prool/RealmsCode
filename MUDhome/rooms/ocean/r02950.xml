  <ShortDescription>You are at the edge of a quiet pool, so still it reflects like a mirror.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you gaze into the pool, it's difficult to avoid becoming totally
disoriented, as up appears to be down and down looks up.  There are wild
flowers everywhere, creating a blanket of vivid colors to the water's
edge.  Saplings and older trees stand back, making the pond a world to
itself in this tiny meadow.</LongDescription>
