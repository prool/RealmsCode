  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of a passage which continues to the south and east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The smooth floor tells you that the odd passage was not created by nature,
but must have been build for some purpose.  The stench in the air gets
worse to the east.  The grim, green stone walls are covered with green
slime and muck.  There appears to be some light far to the east.</LongDescription>
