  <Name>Tunnel Split</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have come to a three-way split in the tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The main tunnel continues to the north, while two others run southwest
and southeast.  A light breeze comes from the southeast direction, and
the floor rises at an upward cant in that direction.  The tunnel going
in the southwest direction is barely wide enough for you to turn sideways
and squeeze through.  The sound of a rusty hinge slowly opening comes
from that direction.</LongDescription>
