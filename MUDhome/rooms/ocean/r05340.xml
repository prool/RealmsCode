  <ShortDescription>You are atop a hill and can see the road to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's not much to see toward the south, as it seems to be an endless
expanse of sand and desert.  Over to the north there is a very old forest.
Far to the northeast you can see two of the biggest mountains you have
ever seen.  The tops are hidden in clouds.</LongDescription>
