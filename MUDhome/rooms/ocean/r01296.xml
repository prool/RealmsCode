  <ShortDescription>You are walking on a path parallel to the Ashton creek.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The creek flows to the south where it will eventually join the Ashton
River as it makes its way to the Nylandian Bay.  On the east side of the
path, away from the water, you can see several tiny houses under the
forest ferns.  The houses are not more than a meter tall, and are painted
in the brightest of colors.</LongDescription>
