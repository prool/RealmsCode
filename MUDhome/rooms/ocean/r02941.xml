  <ShortDescription>You are standing outside the front door of the Elven Workshop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The colors all about you are sharp and vivid, a perfect place for this
snow white cottage with the red trim.  A good smelling smoke puffs from
the chimney around the corner to the north, while to the south you see
a great waterwheel connected to the house.  It turns slowly as the  
water from a stream cascades down its paddles.  A small sign on the door
bids you to enter, if you are interested in purchasing elven crafted
jewelry.  As a sort of after thought, the sign adds, "Please do not
use magic inside."</LongDescription>
