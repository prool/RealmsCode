  <ShortDescription>You are in a cave filled with ghosts of deceased mages.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cave seems to moan out at you.  Every so often, you catch a glimpse
of a ghost wandering around the cave.  The ghosts appear afraid and too
weak to leave the cave which gives them their strength.  They have been
banished here until the evil of Keslar Palace has been removed.</LongDescription>
