  <ShortDescription>You are on a beach popular with tourists and students from the University.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Students from the Iilandi University like to party here on weekends, and
there are several fire rings on the beach which look recently used.  There
are also a couple of empty beer kegs in sight.  The white sand is dazzling
during the day, and at night it sparkles in the moonlight.  Tourists say
it is one of the nicest beaches on the coast of Mordor.</LongDescription>
