  <ShortDescription>You are on the southwest end of the Phexton Bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the bridge is wide, it has no side rails of any sort.  Heavy planks
were laid over a web of ropes and cables to form the bridge, but it looks
like they didn't consider it necessary to add handholds at the sides.  The
water below looks deep and swift, as it leaves the falls to the east.</LongDescription>
