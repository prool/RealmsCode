  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Marina Way, admiring the magnificent Nylandian Bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Marina Way runs along the coastline of the Nylandian Bay, so you can see
all the various ships and cargo entering and leaving the bay.  The crystal
clear waters seem unpolluted from the massive industrial buildup which
has made Oceancrest the town that it is.  On the east is the Lelion Public
Works station, responsible for the upkeep of the Lelion Beach and Park.</LongDescription>
