  <ShortDescription>You are on the top parapet of Gorgon's Tower, overlooking the Nyyron Trail. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the vines are lush and green on the sides of the tower, nothing
lives here on the top.  You can hear a bubbling noise below inside the  
stone tower, and acid vapors rise all about you.  There is a closed hatch
which appears to be locked with a heart-shaped lock.  Some say Gorgon still
hides inside, blinded forever by the herbalist who once lived on the farm 
south of here.</LongDescription>
