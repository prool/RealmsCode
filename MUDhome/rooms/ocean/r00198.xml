  <ShortDescription>You are in a small and cramped back bedroom in Madame Ruthie's red house.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the bedroom for quick service, and the traffic in and out is pretty
heavy.  There are several beds here, and even a pallet on the floor for
those who can't wait.  There is a strong smell of unwashed and sweaty bodies
in the room, but it's not really that unpleasant.  Madame Ruthie makes money
by the high volume here, because even the poorest of customers can get
what they came in for.  </LongDescription>
