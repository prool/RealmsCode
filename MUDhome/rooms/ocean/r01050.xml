  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, just north of Golden Dolphin Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The most imposing thing to see here is the back of Leonardo's Foundry.  The
entrance one block west of here, on Main Street.  On the west side of the
street is a building with a plaque over the door which seems to be in elven
script and reads, "Denise's Imported Elven Silks."  Oceancrest is one of the
major trading stops of the cities located in the Land of Mordor, and often
gets many non-human items as part of the bartering and trading that goes on.</LongDescription>
