  <ShortDescription>You are on a dark path running north/south through the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees have an ominous look to them, and seem almost alive.  At
times they seem to actually clutch at you as you walk in the center
of the path.  The path gets even darker to the north, and seems to
get narrower as well.</LongDescription>
