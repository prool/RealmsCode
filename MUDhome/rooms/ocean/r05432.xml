  <ShortDescription>A cliff overhangs the road, providing a relief from the cold wind.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A narrow crevice in the cliffside looks pretty deep, but you might be able
to squeeze in there, if you want to get out of the inclement weather.
A draft of warm air from the opening creates a fog around this part of the
road, but it seems to be for only a few meters on either side.</LongDescription>
