  <Name>Annetol's Cave</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a hidden cave on the cliffs overlooking the river Othax.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Annetol is a rather large blue dragon that you didn't think was still
alive.  The very old blue dragon is therefore much more powerful than a
standard, mature dragon you've seen in museums, but he's also a bit
slower.  Annetol has a bad temper, but tends to be cordial to avoid 
wasting his energy.</LongDescription>
