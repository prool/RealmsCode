  <ShortDescription>You are on the mountain trail on the eastern side of the mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Nellan Mountain Range spans to the north and southeast, expanding
nearly indefinitely.  It seems to form the border around the Ituk Glacier.
There is a small path leading down onto the Glacier.  Due to the dangerous
and deadly conditions of the glacier, only experienced players may venture
down into the icy realm.</LongDescription>
