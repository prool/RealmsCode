  <ShortDescription>You are in a small hallway deep in the basement of the Palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway you are in continues to the north and south.  There's a door
on the east wall which appears to lead into a small dining hall for the
servants and guards.  You see a number of people walking in and out of
that room, so it'll be hard to sneak around in here.</LongDescription>
