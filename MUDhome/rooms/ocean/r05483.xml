  <Name>Trabin's Fine Armor and Weapons</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a cramped little shop that sells custom made armor and weapons.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Most of the stuff in here was made by Trabin's brother, Toby, who likes
to try to make the unique piece of armor or the exceptional weapon.  Most
of the stuff Toby makes is for the nobility at Prince Rutger's castle, but
he also makes things that Trabin can sell.</LongDescription>
