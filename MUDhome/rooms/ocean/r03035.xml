  <ShortDescription>You have reached a part of the passage which has been sealed up.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although you are somewhere in the eastern section of the great goblin
shrine, perhaps hundreds of meters underground, you feel as though it
might as well be on one of the moons.  This part of the passage is a
dead end, although in ages past it looks like it was part of the network
of tunnels down here.  The sealed up section looks relatively new compared
to the rest of the ancient tunnel.</LongDescription>
