  <ShortDescription>You are standing at a long counter of the concession stand.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can smell many delicious things being cooked here at the concession
booth.  You can buy both exotic and everyday foods, although the prices are
a little steep.  Fried bat wings, lizard shishkebab, and grizzley bear liver
sautee are among the regular selection.  Special orders like pork chops are
not uncommon, but nonetheless expensive.  A special shelf lined with candy,
for the kids, should keep your sweet spot happy.  Don't linger too long,
you'll miss the show!</LongDescription>
