  <ShortDescription>You are in the inner-most circle of the druid community.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The inner circle is forbidden, even to most druids.  Only druids of the
fifth circle and above may enter.  Outsiders are not at all allowed 
near the inner circle, and you being here has alarmed and shocked the
druid community.  You had better leave now before the guards come and
force you to leave.</LongDescription>
