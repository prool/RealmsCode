  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Main Street, taking in the interesting scenery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street continues to run east and west.  On the south side of the road
are two shops.  The one directly to the south is called, "Dante's Daggers
and Darts."  Another shop further to the west is called "Ennia's Venemous
Pets."  Along the length of the north side is a great building which houses
the Adrilite Museum of Natural History.  The Museum boasts a fantastic magic
shop and numerous "living" exhibits.  It's almost as good as Kista's Museum.</LongDescription>
