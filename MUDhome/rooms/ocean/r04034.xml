  <ShortDescription>You are in a western block of the crystalline city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north you see the bustling movement of a large crowd of crystallines.
It's not possible to determine what they are doing without getting closer,
but they seem to be excited about something.  To the east there is a tower
which is protected by a squadron of crystalline guards standing before the
tower's gate.  You probably cannot enter from this side.</LongDescription>
