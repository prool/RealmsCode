  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the central hallway of the Temple of the Rising Moon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The long hallway you are walking down is decorated in the finest golds
and silvers the lands have to offer.  Donations from the wealthy and the
poor all go towards dedicating the temple to Artemis, who demands only
the best from her worshippers.  On the south wall, there is a door which
leads to the New Worshippers Office.  On the east wall is an unmarked door.</LongDescription>
