  <ShortDescription>You are in a fresh water aquaduct which takes water to the temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The sides of the aquaduct are covered with moss and feel slimy to the
touch.  The humidity down here is quite high, and any metal you may be
carrying is probably starting to rust.  You should probably feel assured
that no doubt nothing could live down here.  And no doubt you are as safe
as if you were home in bed.</LongDescription>
