  <ShortDescription>You are walking casually down Overland Drive, admiring the scenery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although there is not much to see around here, the rural atmosphere of
the region is pleasant if not relaxing.  To the south, you can see the
extend of the city's boundaries.  The large City Wall looms to the 
south of Golden Dolphin Way.  Oceancrest is surrounded by a large City
Wall to protect the citizens from both internal and external threats.</LongDescription>
