  <ShortDescription>You have reached a fork in the path you have been following.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A gravel walkway leads east through a meadow, while the main path continues
to the north and south.  You are surrounded by a grove of trees which gets
thicker to the north, while to the south the path narrows and makes it way
between huge rocks and boulders.  A steep rock face looks like it can be
climbed, if you had climbing equipment.</LongDescription>
