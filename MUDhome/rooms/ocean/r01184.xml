  <Name>Necropolis Avenue/Netherworld Lane Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Netherworld Lane and Necropolis Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Necropolis Avenue runs south directly into the Main Entrance of the 
Necropolis, which is probably why it is named that way.  Netherworld
Lane continues to the east and west, making the north border of the
Necropolis.  The Necropolis is surrounded by iron bars.  The only
entrance is to the south.</LongDescription>
