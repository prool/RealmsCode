  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Ministry Way, east of Miriam's Repair Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Miriam is one of the finest blacksmiths in the town, but limits his work
to just repairing armor, claiming that more people are willing to fix
their armors instead of buying new stuff.  On the east side of the road
are the three North Oceancrest Ministries.</LongDescription>
