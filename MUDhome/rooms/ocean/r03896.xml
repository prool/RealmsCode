  <ShortDescription>You are in the main chamber of the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At one end is an altar, and in front of it is a stone table with straps
attached to it.  Looks like a place to hold an unwilling participant in
some kind of ceremonial rite.  There are heavy, dark stains down the sides. 
This room is huge, but no one is here.  However, there is a soft, occasional
hissing sound coming from behind the altar.  A heavy stone door just sealed
behind you.  As a matter of fact, you can't even see it now.</LongDescription>
