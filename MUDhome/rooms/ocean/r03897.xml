  <ShortDescription>You are behind the altar, with one apparent exit.  Looks like a holding room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is an opening overhead which probably goes to the priest's private 
chambers.  There are hissing noises up there, and rumbling can be heard in 
the background.  There is something strange going on in this room, and you 
can feel your energy draining away as you stay here.</LongDescription>
