  <ShortDescription>You are in the crystal cavern, with a crystal city spread out before you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although most of the buildings in the city share a similar size and shape,
one structure really stands out in terms of sheer, breath-taking beauty.
A hugh tower, composed completely of diamonds, rises from the center of the
city.  The builders of the tower managed to secure the foundation at ground
level and also to connect the top to the cavern ceiling, hundreds of meters
above.  The light glinting from the building makes it hard to look at it.</LongDescription>
