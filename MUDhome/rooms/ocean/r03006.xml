  <Name>Northeast Corner of Cellar, by Sign</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the northeast corner of the farmer's large cellar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north a wooden sign is set in the stone wall.  "Behold the
entrance to the underground city."  The small city down here is not
near as large as Oceancrest, but is much older.  Young adventurers come
here in search of the legendary Emerald Armor, said to keep the wearer
safe from all magical weapons.  However, the young adventurer would be
well advised to ask a veteren to accompany them in their quest.</LongDescription>
