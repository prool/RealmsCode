  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern Tower high above the City of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are in a well-lit, red room with numerous glowing orbs and other 
interesting artifacts.  There is a large, worm-like drawing shaped 
like a C on the wall on a blue background.  There are also different
phases of the moon mapped out and a large map of the Kista Valley.
Unfortunately, you can't seem to make out exactly what the map says.
The scroll with the moon phases looks pretty readable, though.</LongDescription>
