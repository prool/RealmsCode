  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Darmanian Way, north of the Temple of Clerical Science.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Temple of Clerical Science is an interesting churched formed as a 
merging of clerical mysticism and mathematical certainty, bringing 
together the clergy and technology.  Unfortunately, no one in the community
really takes them seriously, so very little has come out of this church.</LongDescription>
