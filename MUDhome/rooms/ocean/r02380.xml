  <ShortDescription>You have reached a dark area far beneath the warmth of the sun's rays.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cold cavern you were in has now become quite dark and damp.  It's
very hard to see where you're going, but you somehow manage.  To the
east, you can see a heavy iron door blocking your passage.  The lock
appears to be very old and rusted.  Perhaps it will be quite easy to
pick.</LongDescription>
