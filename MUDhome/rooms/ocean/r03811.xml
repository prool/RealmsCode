  <ShortDescription>You are between a large booth to the south and the main midway to the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several smaller booths are around you, but the one to the south looks the
most interesting.  It seems to be selling charms and amulets, and you
recognize the hyperactive elf standing near the back of the booth as a crazy
old wizard. He was kicked out of the city of Brownhaven for causing the
weather to do silly things.  It rained frogs there for six weeks.</LongDescription>
