  <ShortDescription>You are on the banks of the Ashton River in a pleasant little fish camp.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The river flows rapidly to the west, eventually making its way to the
Nylandian Bay on the Respitial Sea.  A camp fire still smolders here, and
someone has stocked a camp kitchen with everything needed to fix a meal.
the trees provide a nice canopy overhead, giving this place a comfortable
and relaxing feeling.</LongDescription>
