  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the western rim of Marina Circle, east of the Bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nylandian Bridge heads out to the west, across the Nylandian Bay and onto
Catlania Island, a rather large island in the middle of the Bay.  The 
island houses the Oceancrest Marine Headquarters.  It is not uncommon
for attacks against the City to come from the sea, thus the Marine 
Headquarters is permanently stationed on the island for an early warning
alert of invasion.</LongDescription>
