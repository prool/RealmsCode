  <Name>Tower Lane/Kista Avenue Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Tower Lane and Kista Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Tower Lane is a major east-west throughfare in the city of Kista.  Directly
west it dead-ends at the city's Detention and Correctional Facility, where
society's ingrates are incarcerated.  It doesn't really have a correctional
program, but it certainly has an excellent detention policy.  Even innocent
visitors have been known to go in and never come out.</LongDescription>
