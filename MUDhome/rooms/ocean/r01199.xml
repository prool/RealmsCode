  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, just west of Riverdell Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Riverdell Tranquility Park is a large city block, set aside primarily
for natural preservation purposes.  The large number of trees and shrubs
protected by the park makes it an ideal location for rangers of all levels
to train in the skills of tracking and searching.  On the west is a large
weapons and armor retailer.  Known as Evander's World of Weapons, the 
center sells many exotic and rare items.  The center must be entered from
either the north or south.</LongDescription>
