  <ShortDescription>You are near an great stone altar built between the jungle and the cemetery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The altar is covered with voodoo symbols and blood.  A still twitching
corpse of a headless human lies on top of it, with fresh blood running
into troughs designed to funnel the warm, red liquid into a basin at
the end of the altar.  Behind you, at the jungle edge, you hear a low,
monotonous chanting.</LongDescription>
