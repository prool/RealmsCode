  <Name>Jungle Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a heavily overgrown trail leading through the Uland jungle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path twists constantly and changes direction every few meters, but
is generally taking a north-south direction.  The path looks old, and will
probably be fully overgrown by next year.  Evidently no one travels this
way any longer.  The jungle is actually a rather noisy place, and birds
overhead make a terrible racket.  In the distance you hear growls and
roars, and an agonizing scream.</LongDescription>
