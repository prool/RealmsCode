  <ShortDescription>You are at the center of the Ladies Walk in the Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east the tunnel comes to an end, but a major hallway intersects
there, going north and south.  You see a couple of shoppes and an unmarked
door on the north side of the tunnel.  To the west is a wide promanade
which is open to the courtyard below.  A stairwell landing is in the
north wall, and the stairs go both up and down from there.</LongDescription>
