  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hofton Avenue, north of the Sleepy Traveler Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Sleepy Traveler Inn is designed to provide a comfortable place to 
sleep and eat.  The Inn is more or less used for longer stays in Oceancrest,
and the accomodations are much more comfortable than the Evenborough Inn.
However, for entertainment, you probably need to head west into the 
commercial district.  </LongDescription>
