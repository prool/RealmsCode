  <ShortDescription>You are on a road between the rocky beach and a lush jungle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road disappears into the sand on the beach, but seems to be an old
and established way through the tropical jungle toward the west.  A pile
of small animal bones is stacked neatly beside the road, just as it enters
the jungle.  Some of the bones are placed so as to form a kind of message,
but you are unable to read their meaning.</LongDescription>
