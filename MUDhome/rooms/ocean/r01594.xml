  <ShortDescription>You are climbing in the trees high above the druidian establishment.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees are packed so close together that it is relatively easy to
walk between the trees.  But there's always the chance that you might
slip and fall down.  The druids have made almost a second home up here,
setting up planks of wood along the tree's branches to make walking around
much easier.</LongDescription>
