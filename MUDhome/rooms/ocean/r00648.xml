  <ShortDescription>You are walking down a rather unsafe section of Amberton Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road are a number of small temples and shrines
dedicated towards some of the goblinoid and other non-humanoid dieties.
Directly to the east is the Temple of Hruggek, the dominant god of
the bugbear pantheon.  Hruggek is a relatively passive diety, not 
actively involved in the everyday work of the bugbear clans.</LongDescription>
