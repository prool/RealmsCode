  <ShortDescription>You are in a small, cramped alley behind the Trash Recycling Plant.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small access alley provides access to the back doors of most of
the small shops on the other side of the road.  More importantly, though,
it allows the recycled garbage to be taken to the Central Recycling Plant
near the center of town.  The alley smells of urine and alcohol.  As you
walk along, you stumble over a number of passed-out drunks.</LongDescription>
