  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Amberton Lane, smelling the sweet aroma of the grapes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As the grapes in the Chateau Richland Winery are pressed and bottled, it
gives off a distinct aroma, bringing out the most disorientated drunk.
The smell of the grapes fermenting in the building to the east is also
very fragrant.  The large mountain to the north was created by the 
Keslarian Mages some centuries ago, and appears to have destroyed part
of Amberton Road.</LongDescription>
