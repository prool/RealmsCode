  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along Riverdell Way, west of the Snake Eyes facility.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Snake Eyes Gambling Facility is a notorious bar and casino where
people are known to enter but never leave from.  The police have tried
to stop the activity, but seem to have little success.  Gambling is not
at all illegal in Oceancrest, but losing money and owing a shark thousands
of gold pieces with 200% interest per hour tends to cause problems.</LongDescription>
