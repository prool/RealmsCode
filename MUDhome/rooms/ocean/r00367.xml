  <ShortDescription>The Pink Lady Saloon is very popular with the island's local population.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The place is quiet and flies buzz in circles around the room and the free
lunch at the end of the counter.  Now you know why this place is called
the Pink Lady - The woman behind the bar must weigh at least four hundred
pounds and has a glowing pink complexion.  She wears a flimsy see-through
blouse, which you would rather not see through.  A sign on the walls says,
"We don't want any trouble in here.  Take it outside to the alley."</LongDescription>
