  <ShortDescription>You are in the Knight's Walk, a great tunnel made of massive grey stone.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly north is a barracks for the unwed members of Prince Ragnar's
troops.  On the south side of the tunnel is the castle's armory where most
of the small arms are stored.  The tunnel rises gradually to the east,
and goes deeper into the castle's cellars to the west.  Great torches
set high on the wall provide the only light here.</LongDescription>
