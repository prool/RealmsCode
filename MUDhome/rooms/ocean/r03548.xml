  <LongDescription>Draknal the Death Knight was once a respected lord, serving in the services
of King Lyanden.  But he was responsible for a dark deed, and was found
out by the council of mages.  As punishment for breaking his knight's code,
he has been cursed with afterlife as a knight of death.  Unlike a mortal
fighter, he possesses wonderful magical power in addition to being a
great fighter.  This is the chamber where he must spend eternity.</LongDescription>
