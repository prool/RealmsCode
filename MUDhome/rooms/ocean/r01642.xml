  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, west of the Melbourne Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Melbourne Arena is a small entertainment facility where common people
can go and fight the dregs of society.  Most often, thieves and assassins
are thrown to the masses where they are trampled, stomped, stoned and 
otherwise mutilated to a pulp until they're dead, and then stompted on
some more.  It is an interesting challenge for less skilled adventurers,
but not much of a challenge for more powerful ones.</LongDescription>
