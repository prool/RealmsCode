  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Highland Avenue, east of the omnimous Dragon's Citadel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the massive Dragon's Citadel is located off of Neilian
Drive, just to the south of here.  The massive structure has remained
undisturbed for as long as anyone can remember because no one has ever
been able to get into the Citadel past the Great Hall.</LongDescription>
