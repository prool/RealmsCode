  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, west of Nicholas' Enchanted Weapons.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ironically, Nicholas has no enchanted weapons for sale, but likes to 
advertise that he does to get people to buy his less powerful but more
common stock.  The large shopping center to the east boasts a number of
simple stores and services.  The center continues around the block.  On
the west side of the street is a dark forest.</LongDescription>
