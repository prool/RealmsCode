  <ShortDescription>You are walking over a small bridge crossing a river flowing north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wide and rapid river seems to head into the forest on the south side of
the road, but there doesn't seem to be any way to get down to the river.
Hofton Avenue continues to the east and west, running parallel to the
northern City Walls.</LongDescription>
