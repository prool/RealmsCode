  <ShortDescription>You have successfully defeated the white knight.  Now you may train.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only the pure and devoted may advance to such an exalted level of holy
paladin as you have done.  You should be justifiably proud of your
accomplishment.  When you go forth into the land of Mordor once again,
be always faithful and ever watchful.  Do not let the forces of evil
prevail against God's innocents.  And be warned... never flee from evil.</LongDescription>
