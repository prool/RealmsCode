  <LongDescription>This is one of four buildings on the campus which is dedicated to the study
of para-psychology.  An intense effort is being made to understand exactly
how people can learn to control the forces of the mind.  Its been known for
a long time that there are lower beasts which use mind-control to capture
their prey, and although the study of such beasts is dangerous, several
researchers have undertaken the project.</LongDescription>
