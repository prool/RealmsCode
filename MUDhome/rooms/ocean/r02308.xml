  <Name>Jallud's Missing Persons</Name>
  <ShortDescription>It's often hard to find people in such a large city, so Jallud set up this
small service to help people get in touch with each other more conveniently.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As luck would have it, there are no post offices in the center of town.
This is because the town was already built before the city decided to
adopt the post offices as their official means of communications.  Jallud's
small shop acts as a message service to get important information to lost
or missing people you haven't seen in a while.</LongDescription>
