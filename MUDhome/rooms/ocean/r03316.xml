  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the circle, passing the fountain to the west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gravel shifts under your feet strangely, like something is not quite

along the Necropolis path, where untold stories of brave warriors and 
legendary soldiers await you.</LongDescription>
