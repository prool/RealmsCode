  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, close to Nylandian Bay, which lies to the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street reaches Nylandian Bay.  Netherworld Lane, to the south, 
marks the beginning of the southwestern district of Oceancrest.  On the
west side of Main, a solitary small building rests with a sign which
reads "Misty's Travel Services".  The docks are to the north.  You can
hear some rowdy noises coming from the building on the east, which 
appears to be some sort of pub or tavern. </LongDescription>
