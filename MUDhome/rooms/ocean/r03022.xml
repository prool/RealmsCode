  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the entrance to a goblin underground shrine.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ahead of you lies a wide, long torch lit tunnel leading into the
goblin shrine. You hear wails and shrieks coming from the tunnel
in front of you.  Inscribed on the western wall is the warning:
"All unbelievers will answer to Byhtme, the high priest of Maglubyet."
You ponder the question if your decision to come here was such a good idea.
