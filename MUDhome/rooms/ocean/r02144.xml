  <ShortDescription>You are on a winding gravel walkway between a small building in the east
and hedged clearing to the west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Brightly colored wildflowers are on both sides of the walkway, which is
well tended and has been recently raked.  The gravel walkway meanders
through a meadow deep in the enchanted forest.  To the east you see the
source of the pleasant smoke you have been smelling; a small cottage with
a large smokestack at its north end.  At the south side of the cottage
is a pond of water and a great waterwheel is on the wall of the cottage.
A stream keeps the waterwheel turning slowly.  Thick trees are at the back
of the cottage.</LongDescription>
