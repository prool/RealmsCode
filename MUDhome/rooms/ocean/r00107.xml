  <ShortDescription>Main Street continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large building on the west side glistens in the light.  It seems to be
plated with some sort of metal.  Could it be gold?  At each corner there
is a tall, round tower with an even taller spire atop it.  Lightning and
static seems to ionize the air between the two towers at the front of
the building.  Across the street on the east side is a school for thieves 
and pickpockets.</LongDescription>
