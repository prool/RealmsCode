  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lankshire Parkway, surrounded by corn and wheat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Facing east, you can see the entrance to the Klondike Wheat Fields.  The
Klondike Office is always willing to hire unskilled labor to help them
harvest their wheat and rid the fields of unwanted pests like rats and
other vermin.  On the west side of the road is the entrance to the DeNail
Corn Fields.  Farmer DeNail is also always willing to get some unskilled
labor into the fields to do some work.  After all, it helps the economy.</LongDescription>
