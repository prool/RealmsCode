  <ShortDescription>You are on Garden Circle Road, south of the connection with Ivory Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road is quiet, tree-lined and very pleasant.  The Hanging Gardens are
immediately west and a delectable odor of ripening fruit comes from that
way.  Just about any kind of tree you can imagine has been planted in the
living monument.  On the east side you see a small shrine.</LongDescription>
