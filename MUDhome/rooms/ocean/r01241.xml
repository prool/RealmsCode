  <ShortDescription>You are on Lankshire Parkway, west of the supposedly haunted Allisk Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lankshire Parkway runs south into the Allisk Circle.  On the east is the
famous (or infamous) Manor of Natasha de Allisk, rumored to be the last
"real" vampire in Oceancrest.  Although many parties have tried to destroy
her, she always seems to come back, much stronger than before.  On the 
west is the Iilandi Family Estate.  The Iilandi Family is probably the
only family to earn their status as one of the wealthiest families of 
Oceancrest, owning and operating both the Richland Grape Orchards and the
Klondike Wheat Fields.</LongDescription>
