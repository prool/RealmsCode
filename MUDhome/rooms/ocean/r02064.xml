  <LongDescription>The Towers of Kista (or Kista Towers) were built on the ruins of the
former tyranical empire that crumbled due to the resistance by factions
of human, elven and dwarven fighters.  The Towers were built as a general
meeting place for the three races to get together and discuss the major
problems of the world.  The four Towers represent strength, wisdom, valor 
and piety.</LongDescription>
