  <ShortDescription>The dark, desolate hallway continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's strange not to hear any noises at all, deep within the caves and
caverns below the glacier.  You would expect some squeaks or other shifting
sounds, but nothing can be heard.  The air is oddly stale, but does not
smell of decay or death.</LongDescription>
