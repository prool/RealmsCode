  <Name>Gap in the Hedge</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking on a path with high hedges on both sides.  A gap is nearby.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gap in the hedge is not very wide, and the cleared area on the other
side is rather small.  There's a dust in the air that makes you feel a
little light-headed, but in spite of that you are sure you can hear 
giggling on the other side of the hedge.</LongDescription>
