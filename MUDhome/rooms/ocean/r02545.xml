  <ShortDescription>You are on the second floor of Kista Towers in the west hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the west side there is an office with the door slightly ajar.  This is
not as well lighted an area as the rest of the hallway, but a bright light 
comes from under the office door.  Odd that you cannot hear anything, 
though.  Maybe there is nobody in there.</LongDescription>
