  <Name>Glacier Cavern</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The bright sunlight shines through the thick ice of the cold glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although it must be at least five meters of ice through to the outside
world, the ice is so clear, it looks like you could just walk through it.
The cavern runs east and west through the mountain above and the glacier
within.  Who knows what lurks in these cold realms of forever.</LongDescription>
