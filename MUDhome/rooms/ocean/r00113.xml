  <Name>Brownhaven Way/Nathan Drive</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the southern end of Brownhaven Way where it meets Nathan Drive. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nathan Drive runs parallel to the village wall.  Brownhaven Way is one
of the nicer streets in the village, and as you look north, it appears to
be a shady, tree lined street with quiet little shops tucked into amongst
the bushes.  There's an odd looking tree growing here, however.  Looks 
like it may well be several hundred years old.  It stands in a very small
cemetery on the northeast side of the intersection.</LongDescription>
