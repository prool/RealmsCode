  <Name>Lake Kista West Shore</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The water is muddy and dark as you wade close to the western shore.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>:Large trees, hung with heavy moss, stand in the water making an eerie
sight as you duck through them on your journey.  The roots come out of
the water in places, and the moss covers everything.  Water snakes and
frogs dart away from you as you make your way.</LongDescription>
