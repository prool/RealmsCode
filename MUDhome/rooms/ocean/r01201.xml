  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Rosecrest Street, northeast of Khelleva Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rosecrest Street breaks off from Khelleva Circle at a diagonal to avoid
the Khelleva Estate.  It continues to the northeast and eventually turns
north.  To the southwest is Khelleva Circle, a rather nice circular 
path which alleviates some of the conjestion that usually occurs when
three streets merge together.  </LongDescription>
