  <Name>Rutger Royal Suite</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a royal suite reserved for Prince Rutger and his family.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The new owner of the Dragon Tooth Inn reserves rooms for both Prince Rutger
and Prince Ragnar, but they have never been known to stay here at the same
time.  When King Lyanden died, both Rutger and his brother Ragnar made a
claim to the throne, but no one could conclusively say to which of them it
truly belonged.  A war has split the kingdom since that time.  Princess
Runella, a member of the council of mages, holds the Sceptre of Power in
escrow until one brother or the other is named king.</LongDescription>
