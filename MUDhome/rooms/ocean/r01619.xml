  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, next to the Regalia Convent.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Regalia Convent looms on the south side of the road, almost
looking like a giant slab of marble with a few giant statues sticking 
out from its sides.  The large Odgen Family Villa is located on the 
north of the road.  The Odgen Family has been in Oceancrest for a long
time, but is not quite as wealthy as they would like to have people
believe.</LongDescription>
