  <ShortDescription>You are at the bottom of a slimy stairway, looking into a large room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stairway goes up in a tight, twisting pattern, disappearing quickly.
The room you can see has a flickering light coming from it, but you cannot
see what is creating it.  There is a stinking smell coming from the floor,
and a green slime covers the walls.</LongDescription>
