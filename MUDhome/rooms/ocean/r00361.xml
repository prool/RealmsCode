  <Name>Cellar of the Dwarven Drinking Society</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the cellar of a fraternal order of dwarves.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is dark, but there is a door at the top of some stairs where
light seeps around the edges.  The door is only slightly over a meter 
tall however, so you conclude some very short people probably use this
room.  The smell of rum is quite strong and you are a little sickened by
its overpowering odor in such a small place.  There is a new padlock on
the side door.  A broken window leads to a vault in the alley outside.</LongDescription>
