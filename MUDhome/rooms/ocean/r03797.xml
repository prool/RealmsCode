  <ShortDescription>You are at the mouth to a maze of grottos and tunnels known as Prxtl Cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mouth of the cave is huge, but the ceiling gets lower towards the
back where a great many tunnels are located.  A flickering red light
comes from several of the tunnels, making it easy to see, but casting
shadows that dance on the wall around you.  They're very distracting.</LongDescription>
