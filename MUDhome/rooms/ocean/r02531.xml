  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Myrr Lane, west of Magenta Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is an empty lot on the north side of the lane, but close to the edge
of the street is a watchman's shack.  This empty lot is not the normal,
overgrown-with-weeds lot you may be used to.  This is an EMPTY LOT.  
There's nothing there but a black hole.</LongDescription>
