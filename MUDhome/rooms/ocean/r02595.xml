  <ShortDescription>You are in between long rows of hedges, which seem to form a maze.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hedges have been cut and shaped into animals and symbols by the 
gardners who work here.  Perhaps if you note the shapes carefully,  
or drop something, you can map your way out of here.</LongDescription>
