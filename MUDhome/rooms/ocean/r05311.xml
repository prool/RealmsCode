  <ShortDescription>Due to bandits and other unwholesome peoples, this part of the road is
poorly maintained.  The trees are getting thicker along here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the trees are on both sides of the wide road, but you can see where the
trees abruptly end and the great desert begins on the other side of a very
large outcropping of rock a little way to the south.  There is a gulley
across the road, which should be repaired.</LongDescription>
