  <ShortDescription>You are in an area of well trimmed hedges, many cut to the shape of animals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It looks as though the hedges have been planted to form a maze, where
one might wander around for a long time.  At the moment, you stand on a
raised area where you can look over the entire hedge garden, and you can
choose to enter if you wish, but you might be lost forever.  The second
of the Garden is to the southeast.</LongDescription>
