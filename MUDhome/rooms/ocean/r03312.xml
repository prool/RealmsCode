  <ShortDescription>You stand before a large wrought iron gate which opens into the necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gate to the south commands a second look, its simple construction
belies the immense feeling of mortal terror that overcomes you as you
look upon the gate.  It gives off the impression that it is not only
an entrance to the necropolis, but also stands to keep whatever has
been buried in the necropolis inside.  The way back to the road is to
the north, and it is advised that you take that route.</LongDescription>
