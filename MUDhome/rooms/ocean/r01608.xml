  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, west of the Richland Grape Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Chateau Richland Grape Orchard is well known for their finely 
fermented wines and juices, bottled yearly just days after the grapes
are harvested.  The Chateau is always looking for cheap, inexperienced
labor to do work clearing the fields of vermin and other disease-ridden
pests that might destroy the grapes.</LongDescription>
