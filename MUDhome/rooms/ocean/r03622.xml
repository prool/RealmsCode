  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the courtyard near the castle garden.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly east you can see a wonderful garden surrounded by a small fence.
There are fruit and nut trees of every description, and rows of interesting
plants.  A white mist rises on the far side, so it is impossible to see
how big the garden is.  To the south you can see the southern wall of
the castle, and to the east is a great expanse of flagstone with a small
fountain and pool forming a rest area.</LongDescription>
