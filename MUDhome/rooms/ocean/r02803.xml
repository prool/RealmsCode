  <ShortDescription>You have come to a small intersection where two hallways diverge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The main hallway continues to the north and south, while a second hallway
juts off to the east.  It is very quiet in these halls; almost too quiet.
You don't see many monsters in these caverns, but perhaps something has
scared them away.</LongDescription>
