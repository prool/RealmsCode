  <ShortDescription>You are on Leviathan Drive, between the Holy Order of Corellon Larethian
on the west, and the Rodaisl Community Housing Complex on the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the intersection with Netherworld Lane to the south.  On both
sides of the street are large structures.  The Rodaisl Complex houses many
thousands of Oceancrestillians.  Since individual houses for everyone can
not be built in the city, the Housing Complexes were built to house the
people who needed and wanted to live inside the city.</LongDescription>
