  <ShortDescription>You are in a northern block of the crystalline city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south you can see a tall tower which sparkles like one huge diamond.
There is no visible entry to the tower from this direction, however, and it
looks as though any movement towards the structure would be thwarted by a
high gate.  To the north you can hear the sound of running water.</LongDescription>
