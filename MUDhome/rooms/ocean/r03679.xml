  <ShortDescription>You are in a low and narrow crawlway known as the thieve's passage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Many years ago a number of thieves escaped from their prison cells
and were found here, but no one has ever been willing to crawl through
the darkness to see where it goes in the western direction.  A major
tunnel is just to the northeast.  It's probably not right to call this
narrow crawlway a passage.  It's more like a rat's run.</LongDescription>
