  <ShortDescription>You are on Darmanian Way, south of three statues in front of the Library.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The three large statues in front of the southern entrance to the Oceancrest
Municiple Library represent the various factors that put together a public
library for anyone who wanted information to get it.  Books are rather
expensive, and are not easilly obtained.  Some of the statues represent
philanthropists who have given so much to the community.</LongDescription>
