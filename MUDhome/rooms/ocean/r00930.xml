  <ShortDescription>You are in a small alley north of West Hafnia Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The alley smells of excrement and urine, and you see boxes and barrels have
been stacked so as to form temporary shelters for the homeless.  This is not
a place the city fathers would want a visitor to see.  Glittering eyes peer
at you from under a pile of rags.  All of the doors you see appear locked.
Well, that is, all except one.</LongDescription>
