  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Neilian Drive, south of a small shopping complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north is one of the numerous recycling plants in Oceancrest.  Most
of the junk that people can't use gets pulverized and then re-used as
something else.  There are a number of shops in the center to the north.
The entrance to these shops is on the other side of the building along
Ministry Way or Riverdell Way, to the east or west respectively.</LongDescription>
