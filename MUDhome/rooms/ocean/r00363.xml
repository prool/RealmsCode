  <ShortDescription>You are standing in a dusty road in front of Madame Ruthie's old red house.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although old, it looks to be very large, with at least twenty bedrooms.
Several of the upstairs windows are open, and laughing women lean out
them, looking you over.  There is a veranda on all sides of the house
and the front door is open.  A party seems to be in full swing inside,
and one of the women inside smiles and waves for you to come in.</LongDescription>
