  <Name>Vickers House Dining Room</Name>
  <LongDescription>This is the elegant dining room of the Vickers House.
A very long table with at least a dozen chairs around it takes up most of
the center of the room.  At one time the Vickers family was the leader in
Brownhaven's social and community gatherings.  At least until the present
mayor killed old man Vickers in a card game.  The two young Vickers boys
were taken to their uncle's in a tiny village of Phexton in the mountains.
No one knows what happened to Lady Vickers.  Perhaps suicide?</LongDescription>
