  <ShortDescription>You are in the Enchanted Forest Garden, west of the Foothills Trail.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a major trail located a little distance to the east, while the
narrow trail you are presently on seems to go through a very strange garden.
Looking east you see rolling foothills which eventually turn into a
formidble looking mountain range.</LongDescription>
