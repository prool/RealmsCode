  <Name>Temple Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret passage connecting the temple altar to other holy places.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage will take you to the Temple Holding Room and various private
chambers.  It looks like it could also become quite confusing, as it seems
to twist and turn.  Not all of the twists in the passage were designed by
the priests.  Some of these turns look like they were caused by an ancient
earthquake which evidently caused the temple to be abandoned  The Sacred
Holding Room is directly south of you.</LongDescription>
