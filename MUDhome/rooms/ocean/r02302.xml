  <ShortDescription>You are in Dragonwares, a fantastic shop that sells all sort of wierd and
powerful objects from all over Oceancrest and perhaps from other lands.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dragonwares is a specialty shop which used to be owned by Conan, the
Dragon-Slayer.  Conan was a high level leader of Oceancrest's heros
and warriors, and often had rare items for sale.  This was his shop
before he died on April 1, 1994, to get a 'real life.'  Conan was a
member of the Mordor elite for more than three years, but decided an
addiction like this was just too time consuming.  It may happen to you.</LongDescription>
