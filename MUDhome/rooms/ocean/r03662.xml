  <Name>Old Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the old tunnel that is never used anymore.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Heavy cobwebs block the way and a slime covers the walls.  The air has
a putrid smell, as of decaying flesh.  Small animal sounds can be heard
further to the east.  Sounds of clawed feet scratching on the floor and
hissing sounds occur occasionly, and something just brushed against your
leg.  Directly west is an intersection with a larger tunnel.</LongDescription>
