  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, southwest of Overland Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The intersection of Overland Drive lies to the northeast.  From that
intersection, Eidenhoft runs due north.  Eidenhoft Boulevard is one of
the easiest streets to remember since it is one of the few that travel
diagonally through the town.  Heading southwest down Eidenhoft brings
you towards the Oeancrest Memorial Fountain and eventually towards the
southwestern corner of Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
