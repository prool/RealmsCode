  <Name>Main Street/Nathan Drive</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Main Street and Nathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street has most of the commerical and entertainment places located on
it.  It continues to the north, running to the village wall on the other
side of Town Square.  A lot of the entertainment in Browhaven tends to be
rather bloody, since the culture is not up to that of Kista or Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
