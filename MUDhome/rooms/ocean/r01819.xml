  <ShortDescription>You are in a sleezy, run down Inn and Tavern in the darker area of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are in the infamous Inn of the Thenardier's.  Monsieur Thenardier
serves his guests in disgust, singing "My den of soaks, my den of
dissolutes, my dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts, my sons of whores
spend their lives in my inn.  Homing pidgeons homing in, then fly through
my doors.  And their money's good as yours!"  The guests are not all that
pleasant either, but for the price and company, who can argue.</LongDescription>
