  <ShortDescription>You are southwest of Brownhaven, on the back of a dragon.  50.n0.e0.s1.w1</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The open sky is dotted with clouds, and occasionally there is fog or rain.
Dragons don't normally like to fly in inclement weather, because they get
lost so easily.  If you fly into a cloud, there's no telling where you might
wind up.  The winds aloft can often carry you miles off course, if you fly
that high.</LongDescription>
