  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along Islandia Drive, between Jeane's Glass and Glazing
on the north and Hansel's General Provisions and Supplies on the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Jeane's Glass and Glazing provides much, if not all, of the glass products
in the realm.  Glass is expensive to manufacture, and only the finest,
richest houses even have glass.  Hansel's General Provisions and Supplies
shop provides essentials for travelling beyond Oceancrest.  Travelers 
usually stop off here before continuing on.</LongDescription>
