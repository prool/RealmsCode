  <ShortDescription>You are in a stairwell connecting the gaming lounge to the second floor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This stairwell is used primarily by the mages coming down to challenge
the prisoners who are in the game lounge.  The mages enjoy using their
magic on the prisoners as there is no one else in the world to use it
on.  The mages have not dared to leave the palace in numbers for ages.</LongDescription>
