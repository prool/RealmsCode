  <ShortDescription>You are walking around the outer path of the Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This path runs around the northern mountainous structure that you can
see to the northwest.  The strange surface looks very jagged and sharp,
making it very dangerous to climb.  The structure starts from almost
nothing on the ground, seeming to appear out of nothingness.</LongDescription>
