  <Name>Ashton River Road/Phexton Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The Phexton tunnel provides a shortcut to the road high above.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel is dark however, and a hard climb.  If you continue on the road
to the east it will take longer to get to the other end of the tunnel.  The
tunnel was an old mine shaft, and a road engineer decided it could be used
as part of the road, but after many mishaps inside, it was decided it was
safer to have the road outside the mountain.</LongDescription>
