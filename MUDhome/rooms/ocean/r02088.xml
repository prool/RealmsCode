  <ShortDescription>You are on a forest trail, trapped by some mysterious force shield.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You continue to walk around the circle, well aware that you are going
around in circles.  However, each time you go around, you start to 
notice more and more.  There is a small cave to the south that is 
barely visible through the brush and trees.  The question is whether
or not the force shield will let you through to it.  A reddish haze is 
curling around you, even now.</LongDescription>
