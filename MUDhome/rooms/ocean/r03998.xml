  <ShortDescription>You are inside a glass bubble, clinging to smooth, warm walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The ledge you are traveling on is quite narrow, and it seems to rise and
widen as it circles around the interior. There is a red light near the
center of the bubble, or at least something red out there. It seems to be
turning as you make your way around the inside of this place.</LongDescription>
