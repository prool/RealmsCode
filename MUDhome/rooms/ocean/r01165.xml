  <ShortDescription>Eidenhoft Boulevard runs north and south from here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south is the Khelleva Circle, which is a circular traffic path with
a large oak tree in its center.  The Circle was designed to alleviate the
traffic in this part of the city, and was bui8lt by the Khelleva Family as
a memorial to themselves.  West of you is an odd looking building with a
huge gem perched on top of it.  No one has ever figured out exactly what
it is that holds the gem up there, though.</LongDescription>
