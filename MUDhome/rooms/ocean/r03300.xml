  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the east wall of the garden, next to a small brook.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The brook which you are walking along does not appear to have started 
anywhere inside the garden it just sort of comes out of nowhere and 
travels off into the mist.  It looks as if you could climb over the
wall here if you had the sufficient climbing equipment.</LongDescription>
