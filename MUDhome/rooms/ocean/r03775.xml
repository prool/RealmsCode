  <ShortDescription>You are on a walkway passing through a forest of cypress.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Old and heavy cypress trees stand tall here, and below them is a lush
growth of heavy vegetation.  If a person went in there, he might become
lost.  Odd snuffling sounds seem to come from the woods, but when you
stop and look in that direction, they also stop.  You can hear birds in
the distance, but none immediately around you.</LongDescription>
