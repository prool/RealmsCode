  <ShortDescription>The dark hallway runs east and west underneath the giant glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Light reaches this part of the hallway, but just barely.  You can see the
massive block of ice above you, but there's no way of telling just how far
the ice extends and exactly how far underground you are.  As you head
further to the east, you can see the darkness setting in as you head into
the rocks under the glacier.</LongDescription>
