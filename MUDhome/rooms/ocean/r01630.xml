  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, just north of the Grape Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Richland Grape Orchard, owned by the Iilandi Family, grows the finest
and tastiest grapes in all the lands.  The grapes are harvested and 
fermented into the finest wines, distributed throughout Oceancrest and
often exported in exchange for other needed goods.  The Richland Bordeaux
wines often command quite a price.</LongDescription>
