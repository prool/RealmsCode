  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Kafkan Way, just north of a large palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south is an iron gate.  Past that gate, a long, winding path
leads up the artificial mountain to a large palace on the top.  The
Mages that built the palace, also build the mountain and all the
surrounding magical effects.  The Mages of Keslar, as they are commonly
known as, are not really evil, but appear to be by the people who
do not really understand the use and power of magic.</LongDescription>
