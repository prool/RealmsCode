  <ShortDescription>You are on the path that runs around the western side of the Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path ends at the front door of the Mausoleum.  It is a large, stone
door that doesn't seem to want to budge.  There is a small window that
you can look into.  The Mausoleum is pretty small and holds but a single
coffin in the center of the room.  Other than that, the room is virtually
empty, with a few pictures lying thrown about.</LongDescription>
