  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of Garden Circle Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The sound of small animals and birds can be heard from the trees and ferns
in the famous Gardens.  There is a story that there is a mirror pool located
in the Garden, but that only the pure of heart can ever see it.  At one time
the citizens of the old realm suggested that evil-doers be brought there to 
administer justice, but unfortunately the judges could never find the pool.</LongDescription>
