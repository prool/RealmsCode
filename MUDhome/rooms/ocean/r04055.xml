  <ShortDescription>You are in the cellar below the kitchen in Granovetter's Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are racks of wine and great kegs of Uland rum close by, but in the
dark areas you see nothing but dust and vegetable bins.  Although the 
innkeeper and his family are well liked, there are whispered stories
occasionally about a mad brother who is kept out of sight.  Might this 
be his private world, down here?</LongDescription>
