  <ShortDescription>The advanced crystalline civilation lies before you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>you see an entire underground world spread out before you.  Hundreds of
crystalline buildings can be seen, each shimmering in a different color
of the the spectrum.  Not only the buildings, but all of the inhabitants -
every man, woman and child - seems to be composed entirely of different
types of crystals.  Each seems to glow in a unique hue.</LongDescription>
