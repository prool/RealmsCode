  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, south of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Necropolis on the north is guarded by a wall of cast-iron bars
that prevent looters and other grave robbers from entering the Necropolis
at night and defiling the gravesites.  On the south, you can see the 
mysterious Mausoleum on the Allisk Manor grounds.  This is rumored to
be Natasha's final resting location.</LongDescription>
