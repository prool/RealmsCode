  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, near the center of the main shopping district.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the west side of the street there is a large wooden sign with a painting
of ferocious red dragon on it.  Inscripted upon it is, "Dragonwares."  Now
what do you suppose that could be?  Across the street, on the east side, is
another shop called, "The Angry Camper Hunting Supplies."  Further to the
south, about a block away, is the City's Southern Wall.</LongDescription>
