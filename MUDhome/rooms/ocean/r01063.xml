  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Overland Drive and Rosecrest Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rosecrest Street is parallel to the great City Wall on the west.  The waters
of Nylandian Bay are on the other side of the wall, and before the wall was
built the sea would often swell up and flood the city, destroying everything
in its path.  Overland Drive heads east from this point, and connects the
commercial and administrative areas located in this area to the estates of
the rich and powerful farther east.</LongDescription>
