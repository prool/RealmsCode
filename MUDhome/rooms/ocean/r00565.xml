  <ShortDescription>You are on Eidenhoft Boulevard, west of the Reclaimation Center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Central Recycling Plant and Reclaimation Center is the main
recycling and remanufacturing plant of trash in Oceancrest.  All the 
smaller centers bring their recycled goods here to be used in other, less
useful objects in a vain attempt to keep the city clean.  A small reward
is given out to people who recycle. To the west is an alley which winds out
out of sight in that direction.  Several shops are there.</LongDescription>
