  <Name>Bags and Lights Store</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a store that specializes in bags and small items.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's really odd that a store could stay in business when all they sell are
bags and a few other things.  The store owner prides himself on his vast
selection on all kinds of bags, and seems to do a thriving business.</LongDescription>
