  <Name>Cypress Grove</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a grove of cypress trees near the edge of the Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees are old, and moss hangs from them in green tendrils, gently
swaying in the breeze.  Underneath your feet is a carpet of long dead 
moss, making it impossible to hear even your own footsteps.  The hanging
moss makes it difficult to see very far, even though you know the woods
are not very deep.   There is a cliffside to the south.  The walkway
continues to the east and west.</LongDescription>
