  <LongDescription>Adamantine is one of the most expensive metals known, second possibly to
mithril.  It is also one of the strongest known metals.  Armor made with
adamantine is likely to last much longer than regular metalic armors,
even though their degree of protection is equivalent.</LongDescription>
