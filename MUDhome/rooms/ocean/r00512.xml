  <Name>Rosecrest Street/Oceancrest Avenue Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Oceancrest Avenue and Rosecrest Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceancrest Avenue runs to the east and west, fron the Nylandian Bay, all
the way to the eastern entrance to the City.  This large road runs through
the heart of Oceancrest, which is probably why it was named Oceancrest
Avenue.  Rosecrest Street runs north and south, heading past the great
Lyanden Castle near the northern entrance to town.</LongDescription>
