  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, running east to west next to the city wall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of Golden Dolphin Way, Leonardo's Foundry greets the
incoming visitors to Oceancrest.  The foundry caters to specialized 
metals and alloys, however, this service is not without a cost.  Most
of the prized metals, such as adamantine and mithril, are very rare
and also very expensive.  The entrance to the foundry is located off 
of Main Street, to the east.</LongDescription>
