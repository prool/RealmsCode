  <ShortDescription>You are at the western end of the ancient castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The interior wall is grimed and caked with soot.  Large, charred beams
hang from the ceiling, and the wall has bulged in places, as though pushed
out by a terrible force.  The hallway continues to the north and south,
or you can go east toward the center courtyard.</LongDescription>
