  <ShortDescription>You are on the King's North Highway, but the south way is blocked.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Huge boulders and large rocks look as though they have been deliberately
placed across the Highway.  A road crew has pitched a small camp on the west
side of the road.  Another camp is for several of the King's militia who
are here to protect the road crew from bandits and Golgoth, the monster
from the ice mountain.</LongDescription>
