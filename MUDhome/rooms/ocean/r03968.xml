  <Name>Giant Oak Copse</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a copse of ancient and gnarled old oaks.  A meadow is to the west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>these woods are cool and shady, and not much brush grows at the base of the
giant oaks.  The path seems rather well taken care of, almost as if it had
been swept.  There's not much in the way of dead brush, either.</LongDescription>
