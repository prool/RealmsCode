  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Khelleva Drive, running past the Khelleva Mansion.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Khelleva Family, the virtual financial founders of the city of 
Oceancrest, claimed this land for themselves many decades ago before
the city was even planned out.  This road runs straight past their
Mansion and the Khelleva Stables.  It runs northwest, eventually 
hitting the Khelleva Circle.  To the southeast is the intersection of
Lankshire Parkway and Overland Drive.</LongDescription>
