  <ShortDescription>You are on Charybdis Way between Tower Lane and Tiamat Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the west side of the street you see a quiet moat around the Towers
of Kista.  Occasionally bubbles rise from the depths, and sometimes you
see the tail of some giant beast splash the surface.  Other than that,
the moat is rather quiet.  On the east side is a line of small shops.</LongDescription>
