  <ShortDescription>You have reached the North Wall of the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Tropical plants abound here, and the banana trees are ready to harvest.
Soft ferns brush against your boots as you walk, and low hanging shade
trees obscure your vision in all directions.  A small stream of water
is to the south, where you see a high-arched bridge over a pool.</LongDescription>
