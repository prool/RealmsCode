  <ShortDescription>You are on one of the nicest throughfares in the entire village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Fruit trees and shady elms line the way, and several old homes are set
back away from the roadway.  The homes look like old money.  A little
further to the north is where the professional people of Brownhaven
have their business establishments.  Perhaps this is the section of 
town where they live.</LongDescription>
