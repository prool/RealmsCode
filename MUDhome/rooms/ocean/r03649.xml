  <ShortDescription>You are in a dimly lighted tunnel near the castle's armory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is nothing but blackness to the south.  You have come far enough
north, that you must be close to the armory of Prince Ragnar.  This tunnel
is wide enough to pull a cart through it.  Small animals and large insects
infest this place, and seem to be at war with one another.  Looking through
the crawlway, you see the armory.</LongDescription>
