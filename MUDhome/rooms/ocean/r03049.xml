  <Name>Victims of Maglubyet Holding Cell</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a cramped little holding cell, meant only as a temporary jail.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>What nasty fate has awaited the many who have been here before you can only
be guessed at, since none have ever lived to tell of it.  Screams echo from
far away, but occasionly there is a nearby scream which sets your teeth on
edge.  The cell was never meant to be a place for someone to live, only a
place to wait while the goblin priests decide how best to take you apart,
small piece by small piece.</LongDescription>
