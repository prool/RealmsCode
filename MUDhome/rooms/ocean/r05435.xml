  <ShortDescription>You are just east of the road to Saint Anne's Retreat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stone retreat has been here longer than anyone can remember, and
did not always belong to the church.  When the clerics who have retired
here first came to this part of the mountain, they had to exorcise a
terrible demon who had taken it over.  When he was gone, the clerics
simply moved in.</LongDescription>
