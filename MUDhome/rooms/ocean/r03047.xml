  <Name>Goblin Prison</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the long term prison area for the goblin underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Mostly, the inmates here are goblins who cannot conform to the mores of
goblin society.  Non-goblins, especially humans and elves, never see this
place, as they are usually taken directly to the holding cell for immediate
disposal of their cases.  There is a lot of yowling and agonized grunting
taking place around you in the various cells here, but you don't see anyone
you know.  There is a strong smell of unwashed bodies and goblin waste.</LongDescription>
