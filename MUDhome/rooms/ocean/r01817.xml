  <ShortDescription>You are on a hidden path leading from Monument Avenue into the Mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the path leads into the mountain, it appears to head downward
instead of up.  The path leads you straight into a cave that was otherwise
not visible from the road.  You can feel a lot of head coming from the
cave, which is slightly lit with a faint red glow.</LongDescription>
