  <ShortDescription>You've stumbled into a secret passage inside the crypt.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The crypt is filled with many secrets.  This passage must be one of them.
It leads due west to a large room with a number of bright lights.  At
least the room looks well illuminated as your torch is starting to burn
out.  It looks like a good place to rest before moving on.</LongDescription>
