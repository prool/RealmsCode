  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along a seldom used and probably forgotten corridor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oddly, there is not a lot of activity along this corridor, but you do
see quite a bit of decaying bones scattered about along the floor.  The
dust is so thick along the floor that you might actaully find something
hidden, obscured by the dust.</LongDescription>
