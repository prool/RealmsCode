  <Name>Venus Gardens Plant Shoppe</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a warm and sticky greenhouse where lots of plants are growing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Venus Gardens are known for their carniverous plants.  Unfortunately,
the plants have seemed to gain some intelligence and have overpowered
the shoppe owners.  The store is now run by very large venus fly traps
and lillianril, waiting for some unsuspecting victim to come in and
feed them.  There is a porch outside where some of the larger plants
are basking in the sun.</LongDescription>
