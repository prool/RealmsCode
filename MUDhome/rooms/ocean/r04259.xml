  <ShortDescription>You are on the roof of Prince Rutger's Tower Castle, behind the battlements.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are archery nooks and catapult launching ramps along here, and in
the distance there is a hot oil station.  A huge sled of rocks, held in
place by a net, stands nearby.  Looks like the fighting forces are ready
for any kind of a siege.</LongDescription>
