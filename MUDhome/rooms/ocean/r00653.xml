  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the Knightly Order of the Black Cross.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Walking along Amberton Lane is perhaps one of the more exciting things you
can do when you're bored.  Further to the north are the non-human diety
shrines and near the end of the road to the south is Keslar Palace.  On
the east side of the road, you can see the powerful presence of the 
Knightly Order of the Black Cross, the dark half that all paladins must
overcome.</LongDescription>
