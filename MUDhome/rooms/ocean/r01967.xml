  <Name>Millwood Mayor's Office Hallway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The hallway turns to the north and dead ends.  There are two doors on
the east and west walls of the hallway.  Heading south returns to the foyer.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The long hallway seems to drag on, but you know you haven't really gone
all that far.  After all, the building wasn't that big.  You finally
come to two large doors, one on the east wall and one of the west wall.
The plaque above the east door says "Mayor's Office" and the one on
the west door has "Keep Out" scribbled across it in dried blood.  There
is no plaque on this door, but you can see by the dust outline that 
it was there originally.</LongDescription>
