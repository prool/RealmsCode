  <ShortDescription>You are in a large, apparently well managed Assassin's Guild in central
Oceancrest.  The assassins are very peculiar about who they let into
their guild, thus if you're not from one of the other guilds, it's
unlikely that they'll tell you anything useful or true.  </ShortDescription>
