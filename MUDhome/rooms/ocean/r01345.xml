  <Name>Chief Bosun's Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the living quarters of the ship's chief bosun.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a massive bunk on one bulkhead, and single, giant chair sits
nearby.  A lone hurricane lantern swings slowly from the overhead,
casting moving shadows in a dismal and damp room.  The chief bosun is
not known for his good humor, and even the hardiest of swashbucklers
and pirates do not come here willingly.  Why are you here?</LongDescription>
