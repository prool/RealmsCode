  <Name>Bear Marked Tree</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing below a slash mark on a giant redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mark is easily a meter over your head, and was no doubt put
there by a bear defining his territory.  There is a rope bridge
to the west, evidently leading to a cave you see in the distance.
That may be the cave of the hermit who inhabits this part of the
forest.  If he is willing to talk to you, he may tell you some of
the secrets of this place.</LongDescription>
