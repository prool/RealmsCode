  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark tunnel below the hermit's cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Strange varieties of fungus can be seen growing on the moist walls
of the tunnel.  Frogs and small lizards seems to crawl about, often
crossing your path in a nervous frenzy.  Their croaks and movements
echo throughout the passage, creating almost a musical noise.</LongDescription>
