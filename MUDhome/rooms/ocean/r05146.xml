  <Name>Stone Stairway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a stone landing, in a very small stinking stairway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stone is cold to the touch, and there isn't much light.  A flickering
bluish light from below is the only light to see by.  An awful odor comes
from below as well.  Make up your mind which way to go, but you only have
two choices.  A scrawl on the wall says, "PREPARE...!"  Be careful of the
slime you see moving slowly up the stairs.</LongDescription>
