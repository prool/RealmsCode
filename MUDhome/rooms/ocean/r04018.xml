  <ShortDescription>You are in the inner hall of the cathedral.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Perfectly aligned rows of chairs face the main altar at the east side
of the cathedral.  The altar itself is a raised platform, from which
sermons can be delivered.  Above the alter, golden statues of angels
appear to be guarding this holy place from harm.  On the ceiling,
a huge, colorful mural depicts the epic struggle between the heavenly
forces of good and the hellspawned armies of underworld.</LongDescription>
