  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the entrance to the grand hallway in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Through the eastern arch are the grand formal rooms of the castle.  The
great Hall of Heros is directly east, and further that way is the throne
room of Prince Ragnar himself.  Many more glorious halls and rooms branch
from the Hall of Heros.  To the west is the center of the castle's court-
yard where the great statue of King Lyanden stands.  Looking south you
see a number of knights preparing a practice joust, while to the north is
an assortment of vendors and tourists.</LongDescription>
