  <ShortDescription>You are in a room richly appointed with silk tapistries and large pillows.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A young boy, perhaps seven years old, sits amidst the pillows on the floor
attended by several old men.  He speaks and they listen intently, while
one of them writes swiftly in a large book.  A curtain hangs between you
and the scene inside, and a hand motions for you to enter.  You may speak
to the boy, known as Vlassen the Wise.</LongDescription>
