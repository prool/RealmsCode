  <ShortDescription>The Invisible Hand is a low-end thieve's guild hidden from plain sight.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small, cramped guild is filled with all sorts of weapons and other
junk.  It looks like they'll fence any of the booty you've recovered
during your conquests in exchange for gold.  You had better make sure
that you only left the things you want to leave behind.  You never know
who might be picking your pocket.</LongDescription>
