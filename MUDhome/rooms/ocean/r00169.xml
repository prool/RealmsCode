  <ShortDescription>Taragon Road continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is a rather desolate area of the village with a great many boarded
up houses and shops.  A sign on one of the shop doors, which looks as
though it has been closed for a long time, says, "Beware the Red Fever."
A sign on the shop next door says, "This place for sale.  Cheap."  The
road you are on is not far from southeast corner of the village.</LongDescription>
