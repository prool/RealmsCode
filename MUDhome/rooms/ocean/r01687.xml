  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, north of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The omnimous City Walls rise up nearly ten meters, preventing just about
any attack from the outside regions.  Oceancrest has had a long history
of wars and sieges, which is the primary reason the walls were built.
As an additional benefit, it also serves as an ideal law-enforcement 
agent, preventing wanted criminals from fleeing the town.</LongDescription>
