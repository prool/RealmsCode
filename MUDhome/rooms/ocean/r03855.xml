  <ShortDescription>You are in a winding alley south of the Adrilite Museum of Natural History.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Along the north wall of the alley is a very large building which is the
Adrilite Museum of Natural History.  This must be the delivery entrance,
as there are two really tall doors and a guard station.  Several shops
and guilds line the south side of the alley.  One shop, which is closed,
used to be an alchemy shop.  A very old and faded sign over a door says, 
"School of-"  But the sign is broken and you cannot read the rest of it.</LongDescription>
