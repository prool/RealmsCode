  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Nissiau Lane, north of Hagar's Meat shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hagar's Meat shop imports a number of fine meats and other delicacies
from throughout the lands.  Although Oceancrest is well supplied with 
more than enough cattle to survive for years, it is occasionally nice
to have some venison or even some bear for supper.</LongDescription>
