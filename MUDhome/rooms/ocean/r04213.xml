  <ShortDescription>This is the most southwest corner of the great Tower Castle of Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From here, the circular hallway stretches into a dimly lit distance to the
east.  Several torches have burned out along here, and someone is going to
be punished for not replacing them.  The open door on the north side goes to
the Griffon's Heart Pub, a drinking place for the castle's troops.</LongDescription>
