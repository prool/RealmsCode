  <ShortDescription>You are on Regalia Road, just west of the Regalia Convent.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This short road connects you with Marina Way to the east.  Just past
Marina Way is the Regalia Convent, a nunnary and school for women
only.  The Regalia Convent was formed by a grant by one of the large 
estate owners, but does not really follow any major religon.  Instead,
they strongly belive in a monotheistic philosophy, which is considered
hypocritical to most of the other religious orders in Oceancrest.  </LongDescription>
