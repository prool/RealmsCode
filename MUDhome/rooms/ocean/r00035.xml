  <ShortDescription>You are in the office of Brownhaven's esteemed mayor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Like most political figures, the mayor is off on a junket most of the time.
He does, however, have influential friends at Lyanden court, so he is able
to do a lot of good for the town.  Maybe that's why he has been re-elected
so many times.</LongDescription>
