  <Name>Cave of the Yeti</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a large, snowy cave on the east side of Lake Plasnelt.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>For some reason, there is a lot of snow in this cave from some unknown
source.  The Yeti Lord rules over his kingdom from here, so there must
be some way back up to the surface from the cave.  The yeti are quite
powerful creatures, and dine on whatever happens to wander by.  They are
especially fond of sahuagin.</LongDescription>
