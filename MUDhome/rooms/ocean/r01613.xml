  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, just east of the Klondike Wheat Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The reason there are not more diagonally running roads in town is because
they create useless slivers of land that no one in their right minds would
want to develop.  Such is the case with the sliver of land created by the
crossing of Appleton Road, Overland Drive and Waterfront Way.  A small 
monument has been placed in the sliver of land on the east.  The Klondike
Wheat Fields are located to the west, the entrance to which is located 
along Lankshire Drive on the west side of the fields.</LongDescription>
