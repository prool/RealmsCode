  <ShortDescription>You are in front of the grand hotel known as the Caledonia Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Many years ago, the owner of the inn was told he would never die until
the Caledonia Inn was finished.  Since that time he has kept workmen
constantly adding to and tearing down the great inn, so that the building
can never be said to be finished.  There is a maze of rooms and halls
in there, some of which were sealed overnight, and built around.</LongDescription>
