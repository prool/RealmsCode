  <ShortDescription>You are on a short stretch of road called Hafnia Way, east of the Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Golden Dolphin Inn is located to the west.  However, the entrance to
the Inn is located on Golden Dolphin Way, which is south of here.  From
what you can see, it is a very large inn, and seems to cater to visitors
from outisde the city.  Directly east are the visitors stables for those
who traveled by horse, and to the northeast is the city's caravan assembly
lot.  There seems to be a rather large group of people there, and camels
and horses appear to be heavily packed.</LongDescription>
