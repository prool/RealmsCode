  <Name>Foreman's Shack</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are inside the orchard foreman's shack, which he calls an office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walls of the dirty room are covered with pictures of naked gnomes,
and a tall, wooden vat, half-filled with wine, stands in the corner.
A poster advertises a new line of short-handled hoes for field work.
The foreman is brutish half-gnome with a terrible disposition and a
quick temper.  If the field workers were not so heavily in debt to the
company store, they would have left long ago because of him.  He is at
his worst when drunk, and none have ever seen him sober.</LongDescription>
