  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Leviathan Drive, west of an old and dense forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In the pubs and the temples you sometimes hear an old tale of druids and
dragons, but you never hear the same story told the same way twice.  Maybe 
nobody nobody really knows the truth.  Very often though, the tales involve
this very forest you see to the east.</LongDescription>
