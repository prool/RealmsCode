  <LongDescription>Maria's Market is a small, outdoor marketplace where some goods may
be purchased.  Much of the fruits and vegetables are not grown in
Oceancrest and need to be imported.  However, most of the grain and
corn comes from inside the city.  Maria's Market provides a little bit
of diversity for the the citizens' diets.</LongDescription>
