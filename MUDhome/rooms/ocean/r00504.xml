  <ShortDescription>You are on the Cetacean Bridge, crossing the Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Cetacean Bridge easily separates the northern section of Oceancrest
from the southern section.  Nylandian Bay and the Lithium Inlet more or
less physically separate the two sections of town, but there is not much
of a cultural difference between the two areas of land.  The Cetacean 
Bridge was so named because the workers building the bridge were constantly
amused by the playful dolphins in the Lithium Inlet, enjoying the warmer
waters.</LongDescription>
