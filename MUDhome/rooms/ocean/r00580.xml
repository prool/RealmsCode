  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, east of the goblin shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Shrine of Maglubiyet is dedicated to the goblin diety.  Maglubiyet
enjoys wars and conflicts, believing that they bring out the best traits
in all goblins and hobgoblins.  Being of a similar philosophy to Gruumsh, 
both factions are usually fighting to see which is more superior and more
worthy of their respective god's praise.</LongDescription>
