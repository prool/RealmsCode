  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Darmanina Way, north of Doberman's Fine Jewels.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Fine gold and jewels are hard to find in Oceancrest, but Doberman has quite
a stock of them for himself.  He will often buy some goods if they look
like they might be worth their weight in gold.  On the north side of the
road is the Evenborough Inn.</LongDescription>
