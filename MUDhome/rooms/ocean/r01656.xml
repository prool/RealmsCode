  <ShortDescription>You are on Regalia Way, a small stretch of road running diagonally
along the Regalia Convent's eastern border (also running northeast).</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Regalia Convent is noted most for being a monotheistic
religion.  Although they claim to be significantly superior to the other
polytheistic religions which dominate the land, they have yet to be
fully recognized.  Most of the theories they teach are so ludicrous
that most people don't even take them seriously.</LongDescription>
