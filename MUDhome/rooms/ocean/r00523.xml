  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Marina Way, running along the coastline of the beach.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although there is not much of a beach, you can look over the short cliffs
into the crystal blue waters of the Nylandian Bay.  Marina Way swings 
around the rocks and mineral buildups around the west and south sides of
the road, eventually leading to Lelion Way or Marina Circle.</LongDescription>
