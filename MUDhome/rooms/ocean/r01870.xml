  <LongDescription>The Temple of the Rising Moon is a shrine dedicated towards the Human
Greek Goddess Artemis, known primarily for patronizing the hunter and the
act of hunting.  Artemitis is the sister twin of Apollo and daugther of
Zeus and Leto.  She is almost always associated with the full moon.  
Hunters and adventurers often come here to pray before heading out of the
city to the unknown.</LongDescription>
