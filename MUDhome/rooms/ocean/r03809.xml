  <Name>Carnival Midway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking between several small, brightly colored tents.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the midway is crowded, there are only a few people wandering
around back here between the various tents and booths.  There are a couple
of park benches here where a weary patron can rest his feet, before taking
in more of the wonders of the sideshows.  From here, you can still see
the midway and hear the shouts of the carnival barkers.  A loud steam
organ is playing lively music close by.</LongDescription>
