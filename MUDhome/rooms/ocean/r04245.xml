  <ShortDescription>You are at the south side of the main courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A lot of heavy battle equipment is in storage here.  There is a ramp leading
up to the castle's battlements over to the northeast.  The equipment waits
at the foot of the ramp, ready for use at the sound of the alarm trumpets.
A fire is kept burning at all times, and cauldrons of oil are bubbling,
constantly in readiness.</LongDescription>
