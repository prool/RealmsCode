  <ShortDescription>You are in the extemely cold cellar of the Davis Brothers Mortuary.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Bodies on cold marble slabs are covered with white sheets, still and stiff.
One body lies uncovered however, and as you look closely you see it has
been partially devoured!  Loose body parts lie on the slab, and the stomach
has been gouged out.  Most of the organs are gone.  Bloody footprints on
the cold floor around the slab look like those belonging to ghouls.  Must
have been a feast going on just before you got here.</LongDescription>
