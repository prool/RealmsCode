  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, west of the Shrine of Victory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Shrine of Victory is more of a superstitious holy point where many
fighters converge before going into some large battle where perhaps the
odds are that they will not come back.  In fact, it has worked often,
so many fighters still do come to the Shrine of Victory because every
little bit hurts and you can't really argue with divine intervention.</LongDescription>
