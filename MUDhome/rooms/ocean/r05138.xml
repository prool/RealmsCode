  <ShortDescription>You are in the tall and wide southern hall of the ancient castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Long tables once ran the length of the hall, and servants proudly brought
fresh game and other foods from the kitchen.  Now the tables are charred
timber under a collapsed ceiling.  The kitchen can be seen through the
west doorway.  Not much damage seems to have occured in there.</LongDescription>
