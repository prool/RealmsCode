  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark, underground cavern beneath the massive glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The glacier appears to be but a few meters deep here as you look up
through the ice.  Ahead, to the north, you can see the beginning of a
rope bridge which crosses over a massive abyss.  Unfortunately, it looks
like the bridge has been cut, and lies dangling over the edge of the cliff.</LongDescription>
