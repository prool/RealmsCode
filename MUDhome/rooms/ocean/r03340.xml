  <ShortDescription>Here the crushed gravel path is lined with statues in honor of the heroes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walk has statues erected in honor of the heroes of Oceancrest.  When
a great hero dies, be it by old age or by less fortunate means, and should
the powers that be deem he or she worthy, a monument is erected in their
memory.  Small paths lead off the walk towards the burial sites of some 
of the greatest heroes in Oceancrest's history.</LongDescription>
