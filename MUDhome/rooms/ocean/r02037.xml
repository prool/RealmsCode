  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Alturis Road and Garden Circle West.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Garden Circle Road travels around the magnificent Hanging Gardens, a 
monument to the queen Isaria from her husband, King Randolf the Blue.
Randolf got his title by swimming in Lake Kista in the winter.  It was
pretty much a ritual for him as he dove into the nearly frozen lake 
every year on his birthday.</LongDescription>
