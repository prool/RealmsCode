  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, just east of Hafnia Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Golden Dolphin Way runs parallel to the Southern City Walls through
most of the southern part of the city.  On the north side of the road,
you can see the visitor's stables, where short-time visitors may leave
their steeds, and walk around town without having to worry about where
their horses are or what havoc they're getting into.</LongDescription>
