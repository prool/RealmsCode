  <Name>Lost in the Respitial Sea</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Each wave pretty much looks like another, making it difficult to determine
your position.  It's too bad the sky is os overcast, or you might be able
to determine where you are by the stars in the night sky.  That is, if you
hadn't mudded so much and flunked celestial navigation.  Oh well, keep
swimming.  You're bound to find something sometime.</LongDescription>
