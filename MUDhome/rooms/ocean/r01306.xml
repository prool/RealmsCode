  <ShortDescription>The street is quite oddly quiet as you walk down Riverdell Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Even though you are west of the East Oceancrest Guard Barracks, you 
notice that the surrounding area is very quiet.  It is quite annoying,
as the city should be quite busy with activity.  Riverdell Way continues
to the north and south.  A dense forest can be seen to the west, but it
doesn't look like you can get through the thick brush.</LongDescription>
