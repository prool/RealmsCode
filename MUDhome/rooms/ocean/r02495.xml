  <ShortDescription>You are in a small secret passage with a locked door to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage heads north back into the frost giant caverns.  The door to
the south is protected by what appears to be a bone lock, one of the most
secure devices and nearly impossible to pick.  Through the keyhole, you can
see at least six skeletons and a couple of skeletal warriors chanting
loudly.  There is also a key in the center of the room.</LongDescription>
