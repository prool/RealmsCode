  <ShortDescription>You are on the west leg of the Necropolis path, circling the grounds.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a footpath leading north to a cemetery through an iron gate,
which has been left open.  The path on the other side of the gate is
only a dirt path, slightly overgrown now with grass, but it is not
poorly kept.  You see signs of loving care at some of the grave sites.</LongDescription>
