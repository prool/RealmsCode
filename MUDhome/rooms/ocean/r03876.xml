  <ShortDescription>You are in a grove of giant trees, and vines hang from them all.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>High overhead you occasionally see shadowy forms watching you with glowing
red eyes.  Out of the corner of your eye there is movement, but when you
turn your head, its gone.  At the Iilandi University in the city of Ocean-
crest there is a research group that says there is a nest of Ettercaps
living in the jungle of Uland Island.  Ettercaps are ugly bipeds that get
along well with spiders.  Around two meters tall, they have spindly legs
and large pot-bellies.  Their arms reach nearly to their ankles.</LongDescription>
