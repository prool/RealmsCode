  <ShortDescription>You are at the southern path entrance to the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the southeast is Forest Road, a major throughfare cut in the woods.
To the north is a broad path, but quite dark due to the high cover
of dense tree foliage.  The path is clear, the brush on either side
is quite thick, and the trees overhead form a tunnel leading only
north and south.  Somewhere in the distance you hear strange animal
sounds and an owl hoots nearby.</LongDescription>
