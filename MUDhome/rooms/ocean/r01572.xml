  <Name>Natural Spring of Health</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have wandered into a natural spring, bringing fresh water to Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The fresh spring brings fresh water from the depths of the earth to the
surface.  Perhaps like the rest of the forest, the water itself is 
mystical as well.  You see a number of druids taking water from the
spring and bringing it back towards the center of the circle.</LongDescription>
