  <ShortDescription>You have entered the chambers of Elise, the most powerful mage in Kista. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>She is young, but mastered her art at a very early age, and now has many
years experience.  Seeing what she has collected in this room, you realize
it must take a great deal of intelligence and courage to want to become a
master of the magick arts.  There are strange things here, some with arcane
runes and symbols on them.  A glowing blue stone set in the wall seems to
pulse with the runes IHN and JUX.  It would be better not to use that.</LongDescription>
