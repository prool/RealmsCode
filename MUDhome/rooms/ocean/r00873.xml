  <ShortDescription>You are in a wagon with several card players around a gaming table.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The players look up as you enter, but go back to their game as you stand
here.  A short, very fat man sits alone in a corner and stares at you as
he slowly strokes a strange animal in his lap.  The animal is a cross
between a lynx and an elven cat, and apparently does not like you.  The
lynxven is brightly colored with tassled ears and sabre teeth. </LongDescription>
