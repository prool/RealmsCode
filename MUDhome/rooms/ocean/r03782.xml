  <ShortDescription>You are at the eastern end of the Lelion Beach and Park wildlife preserve.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A tall fence is across the walkway, but the gate is open and and a sign
pointing to the east says this is the exit for the Lelion Beach and Park
wildlife preserve.  A walkway extends to the east and west from here.
To the north you can see Lithium Inlet flowing from east to west, and
emptying a lot of fresh water into the bay.  On the south is a wooded
area between the walkway and a cliffside.</LongDescription>
