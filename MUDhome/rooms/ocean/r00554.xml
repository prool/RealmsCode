  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillborough Way, north of the Temple of Ahto.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ahto is one of the more popular gods of the sea, second only to Poseidon.
Ironically, both obviously cannot exist at the same time, and many also
believe they're one in the same person.  The Regal House of Silver is 
located on the north side of the street, providing customers with the
finest silver trinkets, weapons and some limited armors.</LongDescription>
