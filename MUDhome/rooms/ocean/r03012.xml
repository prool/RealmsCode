  <Name>Goblin Lair</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are near the north end of the goblins' lair.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the northeast, you can hear the high-pitched shreeks of baby goblins,
and the nearly-as-high-pitched answers from apathetic goblin mothers.  The
goblin tongue, as you're learning to appreciate, is not a pleasing one.
Passages lead to the southwest and southeast.</LongDescription>
