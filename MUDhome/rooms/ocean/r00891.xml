  <ShortDescription>This is the field workers rest area.  A single giant oak tree grows here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small stream pools here, providing a reflecting surface for the tree
branches above.  A lone picnic table stands in the middle of the area.
Someone has wedged a wine keg in the lower boughs of the tree, and it
seems to have a good amount still in it.  Perhaps this would be a good
place for a nap after a nip.</LongDescription>
