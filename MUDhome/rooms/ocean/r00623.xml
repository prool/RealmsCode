  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking down Avatar Boulevard, between the Bushman Estates.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large farmlands that the Bushman Family owns provides much of the
required fruit and vegetable allowances to the citizens of the city.  
Without the estate being used towards growing fruits, vegetables and other
commodities, the city would have to import these items at an outrageous
price.</LongDescription>
