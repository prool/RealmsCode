  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Stables and the Evenborough Inn are located across the
street from each other to provide easy access for the travellers just
coming into the city.  There are a number of small shops in the northern
side of town where you can buy something to eat, watch some bards play
some annoying tunes, or just walk along the Nylandian Bay beach.</LongDescription>
