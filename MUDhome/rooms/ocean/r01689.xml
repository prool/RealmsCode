  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Stables and Walking Yards are to the north of Golden 
Dolphin Way, providing very luxurious accomodations for long term visitors
of Oceancrest.  The Walking Yard allows horses to get their daily
exercise without having to take them out into the fields or out of
town.  There is not a lot of walking space along the streets with all
the other pedestrian traffic.</LongDescription>
