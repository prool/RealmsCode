  <Name>Oceanview Drive/Regalia Drive Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Regalia Drive and Oceanview Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceanview Drive is a fairly scenic route which is a pleasant detour from
the hectic, busy roads like Main and Rosecrest.  It travels north to south,
ending in the north at Nylandian Bay and in the south at the City Walls. 
Regalia Drive is a short street which runs west through the Fountain and
ends at the Regalia Convent, which acts as both a nunnary and a school 
for wayward women. </LongDescription>
