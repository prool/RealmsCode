  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Amberton Lane, east of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Amberton Lane, if it continued past Kafkarn Way, forms the eastern
boundry of the Necropolis.  Due to some strange magic from the Mages
of Keslar, a large hill was pulled out from the earth and severed
Amberton Lane into two separate roads.  The Mages of Keslar are 
the strongest and most powerful of the creatures in Oceancrest not
directly affiliated with the undead.</LongDescription>
