  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceancrest Avenue, just north of the Bushman Farms orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Behind the fence enclosing the Bushman Farms estate, you can see nearly
every known fruit tree imaginable, and possibly a few that you've not seen
before.  On the north side of the road is a large complex.  There appears
to be a large general store in the plaza named "Madeline's All Purpose
Shop of Wares".  The entrance to the plaza is located on the opposite side
of the building.</LongDescription>
