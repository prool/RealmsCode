  <Name>Pirate Bay</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the western side of a secluded pirate bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cliffs form a protective cove around this part of the bay and cast
long shadows across the surface of the water.  The water is quite deep
and dark, making it impossible to see what lies below.  From here you
can see the entrance to this bay, probably the very spot where the
Oceancrest Navy blocked the way when they found Morgan's ship in here.
There are tales in the pubs of Oceancrest that Morgan climbed into the
rigging of his ship as it went under and screamed he would have his revenge.</LongDescription>
