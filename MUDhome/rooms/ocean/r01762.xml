  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Kafkan Way, south of the Riverdell Tranquility Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large park on the north side of the road provides a nice, relaxing
atmosphere for picnics or other festivities in the open air.  There not
being much open spaces any more where people can go to eat lunch with 
nature, the Park has become a permanent fixture in the city.  Furthermore,
the Riverdell Tracking Facility has also been established in the park to
provide tracking training to Rangers and other specialists.</LongDescription>
