  <ShortDescription>You are in the western hallway of the great Kista Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a stairway here that appears to lead up into the western tower.
As you look up, you notice that the climb up will be long and hard.  No
telling what's up there.  The west hallway itself continues to the north
and south.  The floor is covered with a red carpet that is slightly worn
due to excessive use.</LongDescription>
