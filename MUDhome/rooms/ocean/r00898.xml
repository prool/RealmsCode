  <ShortDescription>You are in the quick car transporter room for the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elves used quick cars to get around the mountain quickly and 
efficiently.  Powered by gravity and literally no friction, quick
cars can travel between cities in a matter of seconds.  Hold on,
though.  These cars can travel at speeds up to 200 miles per hour.
And who knows where you'll end up.</LongDescription>
