  <ShortDescription>All mages start here, but only a chosen few ever make it to the inner circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At this point in your career, the training center accepts all who apply, but 
as you seek higher levels of learning you will find the red robed mages here
to be harsh task masters.  Only the elite amongst you will eventually reach
your goals.  For those of you seeking to advance to the second level, you
must enter the green door.  If you wish to train for the third level, go
in the blue door.</LongDescription>
