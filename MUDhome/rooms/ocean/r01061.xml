  <LongDescription>The Millwood Memorial Mayor's Office is the seat of power for most of
the domestic affairs with regards to the city.  Of course, Lyanden Castle 
is the real center of power for the City of Oceancrest, but the mayor's job
is to keep the peace and provide for domestic tranquility.  Rosecrest
Street takes a turn towards the northeast as it approaches Nylandian Bay.</LongDescription>
