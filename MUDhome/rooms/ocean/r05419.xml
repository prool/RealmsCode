  <ShortDescription>The mighty Ashton River is on the north side of the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is an excellent road following the Ashton River.  West is a fish camp.
The road meanders to the northeast and southwest.  The foothills are much
higher here, and you can look westward over the Enchanted Forest.  To the
east the road continues to climb, and now the mountains are close by.  Looks
like the road narrows.  The elven city of Hafnia is somewhere up there.</LongDescription>
