  <Name>Cross Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have reached an intersection with another tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel going north and south seems to be quite a bit larger than the
one which travels in the east-west direction.  The walls of the main
tunnel are clean and dry, and the floor is a very expensive rose marble.
A soft and cool breeze moves gently down the smaller tunnel, coming from
the east.  There are also cobwebs in the tunnel going to the east.</LongDescription>
