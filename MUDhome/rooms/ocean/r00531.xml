  <ShortDescription>You are on Lelion Way, running north past the Fairy Dust Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Fairy Dust Inn is a nice establishment for people coming in from the
ocean entrance to Oceancrest.  Most of the inns in town are located near
the major entrances to the city, as this is the most likely place to get
business.  You can see the Lithium Inlet to the north.</LongDescription>
