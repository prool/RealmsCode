  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Regalia Way, not to be confused with Regalia Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Regalia Way runs along the eastern border of the Regalia Convent, an
order of women following a monotheistic approach to religion.  Their 
mythos claim that only one god exists, which is omnipotent.  By putting
the fear of God into their subjects, they can manipulate them as they
please in order to get whatever they desire.  The fanciest buildings,
ironically, are the churches, which supposedly use their alms to help
the poor.</LongDescription>
