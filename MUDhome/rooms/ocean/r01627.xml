  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, north of the Circle-Bar Cattle Ranch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large cattle ranch survives relatively well, considering the fact
that it lies only a few yards away from the Allisk Manor.  Not being one
for superstition, the cattle ranchers usually ignore the idle threats
and curses the other ranchers sling at them for being so relaxed in
their defenses.  Nonetheless, they alway have a few cloves of garlic
on hand just in case.</LongDescription>
