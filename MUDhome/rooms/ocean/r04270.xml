  <ShortDescription>You are on the stairway reserved for Prince Rutger and his family.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rutger seldom invites guests to use this stairway, preferring instead to
use the Stairway of the Nobles on the north side of the balcony when he is
with someone.  Looking west you can see the golden door leading to the
pledge room.  The Grand Assembly Hall is south of you.  </LongDescription>
