  <ShortDescription>You are at the southern end of the hallway inside the Dragon's Citadel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Two massive iron gates stand in front of you, one to the east and one
to the west.  To the north, a large plaque is inscripted with the 
following message: "Only the Worthy and Pure of Heart may Enter the
Citadel of the Dragons or be Forever Destroyed."  On the east gate,
you can see a white plaque with black writing that you can't read.
On the west gate is a similar plaque, except it is black with white
writing.  The gates appear to be locked.  The locks glow in a greenish
hue and do not appear to be unlockable with an "ordinary" key.</LongDescription>
