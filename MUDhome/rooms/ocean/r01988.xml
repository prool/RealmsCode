  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret room behind the Repair Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Buying back weapons is not looked upon highly by the great powers that
be, especially if the items are stolen after a battle or other conquest.
Nevertheless, Evander isn't one not to bend the rules.  So, he'll try
to give you an honest price for whatever it is you have to offer.</LongDescription>
