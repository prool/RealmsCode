  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the middle of the rightmost ring of the Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are standing in the center of the right ring, among several acrobat
and clowns.  Soon you get in the mood to amuse people and start doing 
what the others do.  The audience is very excited and shows you with 
its thundering applause that you could be as good a clown as you are an 
adventurer.  You, yourself, notice for the first time how good you are in
standing on your head.  The whole world seem to be in your feet and you
have reached the top of it...</LongDescription>
