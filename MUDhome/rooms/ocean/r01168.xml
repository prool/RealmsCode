  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, which continues north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The long stretch of road travels in a north to south direction, and passes
through the central part of the city.  The Marine District is rather a rough
part of town, however.  Although the sailors and marines serve the people of
Oceancrest, it doesn't necessarily mean they have to like them.  They really
don't like it when commoners and landlubbers drop in their private clubs,
such as the Golden Dragon Cantina, off of Rosecrest Street.</LongDescription>
