  <ShortDescription>You are at the westernmost point of the first plane of Hell, Avernus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Being so far away from the center of Avernus, most of the creatures in
this plane will leave you alone, assuming you are planning to leave the
plane, and not just regroup for a later attack.  Nevertheless, you have
been granted a slight rest, but remember, the monsters are also regrouping
while you wait around.</LongDescription>
