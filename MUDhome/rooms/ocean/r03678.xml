  <ShortDescription>You are in a cramped little crawlway known as thieve's passage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passageway is so narrow that only one person at a time can crawl
through it.  Of course, several rats can travel through here together.
The sound of a rusty, squeaking hinge is louder to the west, but the
sound can only be heard occasionly.  You may have to lie on your back
to get through the next section to the west.</LongDescription>
