  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern rim of the large Oceancrest Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Circle welcomes visitors and friends to the City of
Oceancrest.  The entrance to the city is located to the east of the Circle
about a block away.  There is a magnificent tree centered in the middle
of the circle, but there appears to be no significance attached to it.</LongDescription>
