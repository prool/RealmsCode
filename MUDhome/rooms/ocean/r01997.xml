  <ShortDescription>You are in Dryfus' Imported Leather Shop, catering to smaller races.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dryfus' Elephant Leather Works is one of the few dwarven-owned businesses
in Oceancrest.  There isn't much of a demand for smaller-sized armors, but
Dryfus carries most styles.  The Elephant Leather is twice as strong as
regular leather armor, and usually lasts quite a bit longer as well.  The
light leather armor is also custom made for dwarves, gnomes and halfings,
and lasts significantly longer than standard leather armor.</LongDescription>
