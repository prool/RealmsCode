  <ShortDescription>You are on Garden Circle Road, which runs around the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Hanging Gardens monument was built centuries ago by King Randolf the
Blue for his wife, Queen Isaria, long before Kista was more than just a
simple town.  The Hanging Gardens were the only things left of his glorious
reign when his empire crumbled merely decades ago.  An archery range is  
located on the west side of the road.</LongDescription>
