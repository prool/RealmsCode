  <Name>Animal Keep</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the animal keep, a compound for both exotic and domestic animals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A number of stalls have been setup and a training circle looks well-worn.
There are small animal wagons lined up on one side, and bags of feed and
piles of straw are on the other side of the compound.  Gypsys are known
as great animal trainers and this is apparently where much of that training
takes place.  Several of the great horses that pull the wagons are tethered
at one end of the keep, and some very exotic animals are at the other end.
The campground is to the east.</LongDescription>
