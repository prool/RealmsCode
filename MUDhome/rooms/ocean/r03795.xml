  <Name>Beach Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a path leading from the top of the cliffs to the southern beach.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path climbs the southern face of some very old and weather worn cliffs
overlooking the Nylandian Bay.  The top of the cliffs is perhaps another ten
meters up, and the beach is spread out below.  There's a good view of most
of the bay from here.  Down at water level there is a cold fog creeping in
over the sand dunes, but you can see a road going to the east.</LongDescription>
