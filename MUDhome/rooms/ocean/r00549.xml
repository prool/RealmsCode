  <LongDescription>Leviathan Drive runs north and south, intersecting Lelion Way, which
runs to the east and west.  On the northwest corner of the intersection,
you can see a number of small shrines dedicated to the lesser known and
lesser accepted dieties of different races, such as goblins, drow and
kobolds.  An apple orchid is guarded by a wooden fence on the southeast
corner of the intersection.</LongDescription>
