  <Name>Lake Kista North Shore</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are almost waist deep in the waters of Lake Kista on the north shore.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The shore line is too muddy to walk there, but the water seems to get
rather deep just a short distance from the shore.  This is the north
shore of the lake, and trees and vegetation come right down to the water's
edge here.  If it doesn't get any deeper, this is probably easier to walk
than up there on the muddy shore, fighting your way through the brush.</LongDescription>
