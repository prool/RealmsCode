  <ShortDescription>You are walking along a quiet stretch of Orchard Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Orchard Lane cuts through a large forest region on both sides of the road.
The thick brush and high concentration of trees prevents you from casually
looking into the forest.  Most people don't think anything can survive
in those forests, while others think they're inhabitted by mystical beings.</LongDescription>
