  <Name>The Southern Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the southern path in the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Descending into the Barbarian Pits isn't as bad as you had imagined.  
As you walk around., you notice that the path now curves to the east as
you reach the southern end of the Pits.  There seems to be quite a bit 
of excitement a little further to the east.  You have already seen a
number of younger grunts of varying ability wandering around </LongDescription>
