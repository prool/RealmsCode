  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, just north of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are just north of Golden Dolphin Way, the road which marks the southern
boundary of the city.  The large City Walls protect the people from 
invading forces, but also help in law enforcement, as it is very hard, if
not impossible to scale the walls from either side without being 
noticed from a distance.</LongDescription>
