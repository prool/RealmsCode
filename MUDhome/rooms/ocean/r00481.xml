  <ShortDescription>You are on Islandia Drive, between the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss on the
north side of the road and the Adlermann Center on the south side.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Cathedral of Worldly Bliss holds much of the moral fiber in the city
together, providing a number of moral rules to live one's life by.  Since
the people of Oceancrest obviously can't think for themselves, the 
Cathedral must do it for them.  On the south side of the road is the
Adlermann Center of Marine Research and Oceanography, a large site where
numerous studies of the oceans and bays are always taking place.</LongDescription>
