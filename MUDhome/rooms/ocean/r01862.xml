  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the counter of Gustave's Fine Sword Shoppe.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Gustave is a rotund little dwarf who owns this shoppe and sells swords
by day, but visits the ladies by night.  He has been known to stagger
down the streets at dawn, singing at the top of his voice, with several
dwarven ladies on his massive arms.  But he does make very fine swords.
A list is available for prospective customers.</LongDescription>
