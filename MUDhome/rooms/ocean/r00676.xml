  <ShortDescription>You are walking past the Hofton Ziggurat on the south side of Hofton Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Hofton Ziggurat has an octagonal base, which rises up in a pyramid 
shape approximately fifty meters up.  The fancy architecture is based on
the ancient Allakaren Pyramid, but is not quite as impressive as the
latter.  Although replicated, no one has ever really captured the style
of the ancient pyramids.</LongDescription>
