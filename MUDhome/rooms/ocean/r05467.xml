  <Name>Castle Rutger Road</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the bottom of a series of swithcback turns leading up to the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road is wide and covered with gravel to prevent it becoming a mire
during the winter months.  Troops must be able to be deployed in a hurry,
and it wouldn't look good for them to get stuck on their own road.  The road
gets very steep to the northeast.</LongDescription>
