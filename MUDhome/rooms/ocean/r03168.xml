  <Name>Lost in the Respitial Sea</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The sea is calm and you seem to have no trouble swimming for hours at a time.
However, you are lost, you know.  Each wave you see looks pretty much like
the last one and you haven't seen land in a long time.  At night, the stars
may help you navigate, but then again, maybe not.</LongDescription>
