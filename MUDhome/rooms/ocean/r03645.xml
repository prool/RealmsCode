  <ShortDescription>You are deep under the castle in a very dark tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel continues to the north and south, silent and pitch black in
both directions.  Your boots echo loudly against the walls on either 
side, but the sound is lost ahead of you and behind you.  This is a very
long tunnel.  The air is stale and dry.</LongDescription>
