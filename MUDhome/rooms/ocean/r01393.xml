  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow hallway leading to the Cremetorium.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although not really a 'secret' hallway, most people visiting the
Mausoleum never give it a second glance.  The east hallway leads to the
Crematorium.  The ashes are then returned to either the Mausoleum
or placed in the Crypt.</LongDescription>
