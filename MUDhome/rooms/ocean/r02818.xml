  <ShortDescription>The dark hallway ends abruptly here at a large door which is sealed.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dark hall heads back to the south into the darkness.  On the north
side of the hall is a large, silvery door with some arcane writing on it.
It's pretty hard to read, but the symbols seem to say BEWARE.  There
doesn't seem to be a lock on the door.</LongDescription>
