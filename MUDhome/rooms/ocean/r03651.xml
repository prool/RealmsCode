  <ShortDescription>You are in Prince Ragnar's armory vault where the latest weapons are stored.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only the most highly prized of Prince Ragnar's secret weapons and armor
are stored here in the vault.  The hair on your body stands out in all
directions as you feel the charge of the magic in this room.  As you look
about, you see most of the weapons are locked in place, but a few can be
taken immediately.  There is a crystal table in the middle of the room
with a weapon on it.</LongDescription>
