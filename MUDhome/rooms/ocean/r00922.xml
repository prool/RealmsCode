  <ShortDescription>You are on the southern part of the road which encircles the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elves are very proud of Hafnia, but they still tell stories of the lost
city of Caledonia.  Long ago the elves were driven out of Caledonia by the
mountain trolls, and then the dragons took over the city and will not allow
them to return.  The road continues to the southeast, and intersects Hafnia
Boulevard to the north.</LongDescription>
