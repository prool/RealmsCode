Help on: *fixup

This command allows you to make multiple word exits in
rooms. You must first make them with underscores. For
example, if you want to make an "iron door" exit, you
must first make it "iron_door". Then after that you may
use *fixup to remove the underscores. Be sure to set any
exit flags (*dmh xflags) before you use *fixup. If you
forget any, you may use *unfixup to return the underscores.

Syntax: *fixup (underscored exit name)
