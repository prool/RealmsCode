Help on: cset (SETTING CREATURES)

	Staff members are able to set various values 
on any creature (non-player). Some of these functions are
restricted, depending on the staff level of the user. The 
various syntaxes used to set different things on creatures 
are described below. In all cases, wherever 'mob' is seen, 
assume that to be the creature being manipulated. # is 
always an integer.

ARMOR CLASS
:*set c mob ac #
	This will set a creature's armor class. # should be an 
integer from -127 to +127. AC is divided by 10 and rounded 
down. For example, a creature with an -83 AC would have an AC 
of 8. It is best to never use this option. The *balance 
command should be used instead, in order to have continuity 
across the game. *bh balance for more information.

AGGRO(RANDOM) LOAD CHANCE
:*set c mob ag #
	This will set a creature's % chance to be randomly 
aggressive on loading. # Should be from 0 to 100, as it 
represents a percentage. For example, if a creature had a 50% 
random aggro chance, it would have a 50% chance to have the 
TENDENCY to go randomly aggro. The other half of the time, 
it'd load as a normal creature. Mflag #165 needs to be set 
prior to using this option. It is recommended that you get 
DM/CT assistance before you try to mess with this option.

AGGRO(RANDOM) ON UPDATE CHANCE
:*set c mob au #
	This option sets the % chance per creature update 
cycle (every 1-2sec) for a monster which is randomly 
aggressive (see above) to go aggressive and attack. # can 
be anything from 0-100, but it is recommended it be no 
higher than 10. It is recommended that you get DM/CT 
assistance before you try to mess with this option.

ALIGNMENT
:*set c mob al #
	This option allows you to set a creature's alignment. 
# should be an integer from -1000 to 1000. Negative values
indicate evil alignment, 0 means neutral, and positive 
indicates good. This number will represent how far one way 
or another a player's alignment will change when they attack 
the creature. Keep in mind, however, that the actual change 
of a player's alignment is really only 1/5 of the actually 
alignment value. For example, if a player attacks a creature 
with an alignment value of +150, the player's alignment will 
move 30 toward evil, and not the full 150. It is recommended 
that you do not set an alignment higher or lower than 150 
without the permission of a DM. The max value (positive or 
negative) that a creator is allowed to set on a creature, is 
equal to that creature's level times 10.

ASSIST MOBS
:*set c mob a(1-8) #
:*set c mob a del
	This option will allow you to set which other 
creatures the creature will assist in combat. A creature can 
have up to 8 different creatures in which it will assist. # 
is the index number of the creature which will be assisted.
	The second option can be used to delete all of the
creature's current assist monster slots, without having to
do it manually one at a time.
 
Example:
:*set c mob a4 2010
This will set assist slot #4 to creature number 2010. So if
any creature with the number 2010 is in combat in the room
with a player, the creature will jump to its assistance.
	
CAST CHANCE
:*set c mob cast #
	This option will set the % chance that a monster will
attempt to cast rather than hit on its next attack. # needs
to be from 1-100. Generally, mage/casting type monsters will
always have a high percentage here. Note that this must be
used in conjunction with the casting mflag(18) as well as the
cast percent mflag(43). Ask a CT or DM if you need help.

CLAN
:*set c mob clan #
	This option allows you to set a creature's clan. If
a monster is of a certain clan and is aggressive, it will
not attack players which are members of its clan. # can be
any valid clan number. You can find these with the *clanlist
command.

CLASS
:*set c mob cls #
	This option allows you to set a creature's class. If
applicable, all monsters should have a class set. Class of
a monster determines its initial saving throw values, as
well as how well some of its various abilities might work.
It also can dictate how well some abilities work AGAINST
a creature, such as stealing. # is the number of the class.
That can be found by typing *bh char.

CONSTITUTION
:*set c mob con #
	This allows you to set a creature's constitution. The
higher the value, the more hit poinyd the creature gets 
back per tick. # needs to be from 1 to 30.

DEXTERITY
:*set c mob dex #
	This allows you to set a creature's dexterity. The
higher the dexterity, the harder a monster is to circle,
and the more of an AC bonus it may get. In addition, if
a monster has a dexterity of 20+, it is automatically
considered to be hasted, and it will attack every 2sec
and not every 3sec. # needs to be from 1 to 30

DAMAGE
:*set c mob dn #
	This sets the number of dice rolled for the damage
the creature does.
:*set c mob ds #
	This sets the number of sides of each die rolled.
:*set c mob dp #
	This sets the added points to the roll of the dice.

For example:
:*set c mob dn 10
:*set c mob ds 5
:*set c mob dp 10
	This will make a creature do 10d5+10 damage, or about
20-60 points per hit. 10 5-sided dice are rolled and added 
up, and then 10 is added to the result.
	It is recommended that the *balance command be used
to set this at all times, so as to have continuity 
throughout the whole game. Creators are forced to use the 
*balance command, as they are unable to manually set 
creature damage dice.

ENEMY MONSTERS
:*set c mob e(1-4) #
:*set c mob e del
	This allows you to set the numbers of monsters that the
creature will automatically attack on sight. For example, it
might be set on a militiaman so that he automatically will
attack a goblin that spawns into the room. Each creature can
have up to 4 different enemy creature types. # must be the
number of a valid creature number. It is advised that anyone
using this receives the permission/guidance of a DM first.
	The second option can be used to delete all of the
creature's current enemy monster slots, without having to
do it manually one at a time.

Example:
:*set c mob e3 2010
	This will set the creatures enemy creature slot #3 to
monster number 2010.

EXPERIENCE
:*set c mob exp #
	This allows you to set a monster's experience point
value. Note that it is highly DISCOURAGED to set experience
this way, and this should only rarely be used, if ever. The
proper way to set experience is with the *balance command.
Creators are unable to use this option, and are they are
forced to use *balance.

FLAGS
:*set c mob f #
	This allows you to set a monster's flags. A list of
monster flags can be found by doing *bh mflags. # must be
a valid monster flag. Setting the flag will turn the flag
on if it is off, and it will turn it off if it is on.

GOLD
:*set c mob gp #
	This option is for setting a creature's current max
gold dropped. Creators are only able to set a max amount
of gold dropped equal to the creature's experience value
times 2. For example, for creators, a creature worth 100exp 
would only be able to have a maximum of 200gp.

HIT POINTS
:*set c mob hp #
:*set c mob hm #
	The first option sets a creature's current hit
points, and the second option sets its max hit points.
Both must be set on all new monsters. It is not advised
to use this option ever, as the *balance command takes
care of this for you. Please use the *balance command at
all times for this whenever possible. Creators are unable
to use these two options, and they must use *balance.

INTELLIGENCE
:*set c mob int #
	This command allows you to set a monster's intelligence
value. The higher the value, the more likely the monster
will do more intelligent things. It is important to remember, 
that if a monster's intelligence is 15 or higher, it will 
always attack players and not their pets. In addition, higher 
intelligence means a greater chance for a monster to yell for 
help, should that flag be set. Lower intelligence can often
make a monster immune to charm/hypnotize, and any other mind
effecting things. All casting monsters should have at least a 
13 intelligence. # needs to be from 1 to 30.

INVENTORY
:*set c mob inv (1-10) (item)
:*set c mob inv del
	Items a monster drops can be set with this option. Each
monster has up to 10 item slots. Any type of object can be
put in these slots, or any number of slots can hold the same
type of item. Before you set a monster inventory, you must
get the desired item into your inventory by using the *create
command. You then set the item to whichever monster slot you
wish to put it in. Creators are unable to use this option,
as they cannot do anything relating to objects. The second
option will allow you to quickly delete all of a monster's 
inventory slots.

Example:
	First, you must get a dirk and a hazy potion into your 
own inventory. Then you do these commands:
:*set c mob inv 1 dirk
:*set c mob inv 2 dirk
:*set c mob inv 6 hazy
	This will set the creature's inventory slots #1 and #2
to hold the dirk, and #6 to hold a hazy. This means that the
creature will have a CHANCE to have these items whenever it
loads/spawns into the game. If you set the same item in
many slots, there is more chance that item will be on the
monster when it loads/spawns.

JAIL ROOM
:*set c mob jail #
	This option is used in conjunction with creatures
flagged to knock people out and throw them in jail(130).
If the jail room is not set, and the flag is set, then
the Highport Jailhouse(room 2650) is the default. Otherwise, 
the room # which the player wakes up will be # set.

LANGUAGE(Current)
:*set c mob lc #
	This will set a creature's current language spoken
when it loads/spawns. A list of languages can be seen by
doing *bh languages.

LEVEL
:*set c mob lvl #
	A creature's level can be set with this option.
Level must be from 1 to 30. It is advised that you do not
use this option ever to set level. It is better to rely
on the *balance command instead. Creators are not able to
use this option, and they must use *balance for level.

MAGIC POINTS
:*set c mob mp #
:*set c mob mm #
	The first option sets a creature's current magic
points, and the second sets its max magic points. Both
are required to be set if a monster is to cast. Keep in
mind that for a monster to cast, it must have both the
casting mflag set(18), as well as the cast percent mflag
(43) set. Ask a CT or DM for assistance if you do not
understand.

MAX KILLING LEVEL
:*set c mob ml #
	This allows you to set a restriction on how high
level a player can be to attack the creature. # must be
from 1 to 30. For example, if you only want players level
10 and below fighting a monster, you would set # to 10.

NUMBER ARRIVING(Numwander)
:*set c mob num #
	This allows you to set how many of a certain creature
can arrive at a time. # can be from 1 to 6. At load/spawn
time, the game will have 1-# creatures arrive. Try to use
this sparingly, and if you are going to make more than 2
creatures ever arrive at a time, please consult a DM first 
before you do so. Too many creatures arriving can be a 
detriment to game balance, and it can also really get 
people killed very quickly.

PIETY
:*set c mob pie #
	This allows you to set a monster's piety value. Higher
piety means faster ticking for the monster. # must be from
1 to 30.

RACE
:*set c mob race #
	This option is used to set a creature's race. A list of
races and their numbers can be found by doing *bh char. If it
is applicable, a monster should ALWAYS have its race set. Race
will determine which languages a monster understands, as well
as a creatures initial saving throw values. It will also be
used for racial relations and affinities. It is very important
to set race if a creature would have a race.

REALM(Magic)
:*set c mob r(0-5) #
	This option is used to set a creature's magical realm
% value. # must be an integer from 0 to 1000000. Depending on
how high the number is, the higher the % in that magical
realm. Depending on the class set on the creature, more or
less will need to be set on a realm to give it a higher %.
Trial and error will show you what amount to set. Note that
realm 0 is earth, and realm 5 is cold.
Example:
:*set c mob r3 100000
	This gives a creature 100000 points in realm #3(fire).
That's the equivalent to 35% for no class set, and 72% if
the creature is set to class mage.

SAVING THROWS
:*set c mob s(1-5) #
:*set c mob sav d
	This allows you to manually set a creature's saving
throw values. # needs to be 0-100, as it is a percentage.
The saves, in order, are: POI, DEA, BRE, DEA, and SPL. It
is the same order when you look at the "sc" command, or
check *status (*bh status) on a creature. This should never
be done without DM supervision, as it is a complicated
process.
	The second option will delete all of a creatures
saves, so they do not have to all be set to 0 manually.
Example:
:*set c mob s2 50%
	This will give a creature a 50% save value in its
Death/Traps save.

SPELLS
:*set c mob spl #
:*set c mob spl del
	This option will set a creatures spells. # must be
a valid spell # found in *bh spells. If the spell is off,
it will be turned on, and if it is on, it will be turned
off. Note that this method does not need to be used if
you know the spell. In that case, you can simply teach
a creature the spell, and teach it again to them to make
them lose/unlearn it. It is recommended that this option 
never be used if it can be avoided.
	The second option will allow you to delete all of
a monster's spells without having to delete them all
one by one manually.

STRENGTH
:*set c mob str #
	This allows you to set a creature's strength. A higher
strength will cause a creature to sometimes hit harder, and
it also has other various strength-related effects. # must
be from 1 to 30.

THAC0("To Hit Armor Class 0")
:*set c mob thac #
	This allows you to set a creature's thac0. The lower
a creature's thac0, the easier it can hit armor class 0.
Whenever a monster attacks, it rolls 1-20 on a 20-sided die.
If a creature's target has an AC of 0, then the creature will
need to roll its thac0 or better to hit. If the AC is higher,
then it modifies what the creature needs to roll. # must be
from -20 to 20. It is recommended that this option never be
used, and that the *balance command be used instead to set
this. Creators are unable to set this manually, and they 
are forced to use *balance to do it.
Example:
	If a creature's thac0 is 12, and its target's AC 
is 5, then the creature will need to roll a 7 or better to
hit (thac0 - target AC).
