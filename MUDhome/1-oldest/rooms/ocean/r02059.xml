  <Name>Moat Around the Kista Towers</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You made the foolish mistake of falling into the moat around the Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The moat is depressed about three meters from the surface of the town. 
Luckily, you know how to swim relatively well, but that's probably not
going to save you from the alligators and other ugly creatures the 
rulers of Kista keep unfed in here.  It looks like a long way up the
slippery sides of the moat.</LongDescription>
