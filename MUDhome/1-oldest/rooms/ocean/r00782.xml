  <ShortDescription>You have entered a magnificant crystal room connecting the jacinith hall
extending to the east and west, and the ruby hallway extending to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room reflects a lot of light, making it hard to tell which direction
you are actually heading.   Far to the south, you can make out another
crystal room and a stairway.  Looking to the east, you can see yourself in
the distance standing in a crystal hallway.  Is it an illusion or isn't it?</LongDescription>
