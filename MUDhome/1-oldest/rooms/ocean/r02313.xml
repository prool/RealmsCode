  <ShortDescription>You are in a very rowdy and noisy bar in the center of the town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's nothing like being in a barfight, and that looks like where you've
landed yourself in this time.  The rowdy bar quiets down from time to time,
but the constant barrage of disorderly drunks, morality police and other
unfriendly faces always makes for an interesting time.</LongDescription>
