  <Name>Caledonia Road/Poor Alley</Name>
  <ShortDescription>Caledonia Road intersects with Poor Alley to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are in a very shabby part of the village, and everywhere you look, you
see tiny, makeshift houses.  They appear to have be constructed of anything
that was at hand.  The house on the corner was apparently made from old
packing boxes, each labeled, "Uland Rum."  A rather wide alley extends to
the south.  People who live here refer to it as Poor Alley.</LongDescription>
