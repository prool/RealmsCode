  <ShortDescription>You are on Monument Avenue, north of the Chateau Richland Winery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Chateau Richland Winery is divided into three major sections, the
front entrance, the winery itself and the fermenting buildings.  All are
within the same city block, with the Grape Orchard on the other side of
the road.  The full-bodied wines the Chateau Richland Winery makes 
usually sell for much more than most people can make in a week.</LongDescription>
