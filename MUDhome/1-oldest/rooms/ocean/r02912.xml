  <ShortDescription>You are in the inner sanctum of the great wasteland known as Avernus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The inner sanctum is not a very safe place to be.  It is constantly
patrolled and guarded by fierce abishai and occassional dragons.  At
the center of Avernus is Tiamat, the Chromatic Dragon.  She is one of
the fiercest dragons known to all the universe, and perhaps beyond.  
Tiamat can attack with all five heads and claw with her body at the
same time, making her one of the most formitable opponents around.</LongDescription>
