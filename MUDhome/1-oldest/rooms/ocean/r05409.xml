  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Ashton River Road, which runs east and
west, and the Foothills Trail, which takes a southeast course.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A sign post points southeast and says the dwarven mining community of
Nyyron is a few kilometers in that direction.  There are rolling hills in
between, so you cannot see any sign of buildings in that direction. </LongDescription>
