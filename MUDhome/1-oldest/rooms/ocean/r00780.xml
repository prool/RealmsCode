  <Name>Orange Jacinith Hall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a magnificent hall made completely of orange jacinith.  The
way continues to the north and south.  To the south, you can see the
iron gate through which you originally entered.  To the north, the
hallway seems to go on forever.  Strangely, you can see yourself in it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This hallway is very deceptive.  You appear to be heading around in 
circles but can't really tell one way or another.  As you continue to
explore this very odd hallway, you notice that to the north and south
are two giant crystals that reflect light, giving an appearance of
an endless corridor.</LongDescription>
