  <ShortDescription>You are in the large room with a giant shark tank in the center of it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Sharks are perhaps one of the most deadly creatures of the sea.  Although
they usually travel alone, they will often converge on a single prey when
they smell blood.  The management suggests that you do not enter the
large tank, but watch the sharks from the outside.  </LongDescription>
