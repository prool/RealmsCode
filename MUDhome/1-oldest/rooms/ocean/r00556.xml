  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, south of the Fellowship Hall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Among other things, the Fellowship tries to convert people to their cult,
as do many of the religious centers in Oceancrest.  The Fellowship members
are a little more pursuasive, though, and tend to really annoy people.  It
may not be a good idea to read any of the material handed out by the 
Fellowship, as it's likely to be very confusing.</LongDescription>
