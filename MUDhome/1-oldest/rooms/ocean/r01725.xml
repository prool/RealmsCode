  <ShortDescription>You are on the southern rim of the mysterious Allakaren Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Allakaren Circle houses the Tree of Life, or so the mystics like to
call the large tree which has grown at the center of this circle for 
ages beyond that which can be remembered.  The Tree is guarded by a light
wire fence running around the Circle.  It was believed to be the tree of
the Pharaoh Allakaren, after which the Circle is named.</LongDescription>
