  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Islandia Drive, between the War Veteran's Historical
Library on the north and the Bendine Aquarium and Marina on the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The War Veteran's Historical Library is really of little importance to
the common person, but a few historians and a couple of proud fighters might
occasionlly stop by to do some research.  On the south side of the road
is the Bendine Aquarium and Marina, where all sorts of strange and exotic
creatures can be found.</LongDescription>
