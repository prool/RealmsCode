  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern tower stairwell which winds around the large tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>These stairs have been unused for a very long time.  The smell of dust and
mustiness is mixed with a perfume which seems to get stronger near the top
of the tower.  A small window allows you to see a grand view of Kista below.</LongDescription>
