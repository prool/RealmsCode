  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the western face of Golgoth Mountain. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path has become difficult in both directions, slowing your efforts.
Not far from the lonely path is a strange tangle of long, brown hairs
hooked onto a nearby tree branch.  The tree has been rubbed smooth at
least two meters above the ground, and strange prints are under the tree.
All other signs of animal life have seemingly disappeared from around
the area, and now only the incessant howling of a forlorn wind remains.</LongDescription>
