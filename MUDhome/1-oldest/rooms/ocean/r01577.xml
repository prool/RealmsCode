  <Name>Rose Orchard</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very dense rose orchard with rose bushes virtually everywhere.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The rose bushes are not really aligned in any real order, but rather
seem to have natually grown in.  The druids have kept the rose bushes
as they are, rather than uproot them and organize them.  It gives the
area a sense of wilderness combined with nature's beauty.</LongDescription>
