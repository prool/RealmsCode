  <LongDescription>In order to better serve the people of Oceancrest, the postal system
was enacted to provide superior communications between various people
in the city.  Because of the vast size the city had grown to, it became
quite a task to walk from one end of the city to the other, just to 
visit for a few hours.</LongDescription>
