  <ShortDescription>You are on Ashton River Road, just east of the Foothills Trail.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road is rather steep to the east, but has a downward slope going to the
west.  The Ashton River looks like it calms down further west, but is pretty
wild coming from the foothills.  It looks like fishermen have made a nice
little camp under the trees by the river bank.</LongDescription>
