  <ShortDescription>You are on Alturis Road, north of the entrance to the Cathedral of Veratus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A great many travelers from distant places stop here, because Veratus, the
oracle who is inside, will answer at least one question from anyone.
If the questioner asks interesting questions, the oracle will sometimes
continue to answer them.  If you seek knowledge, this is a good place to
start.  Be sure to cover your eyes inside.  The monks insist on that.</LongDescription>
