  <Name>Dark Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a tunnel that is quite dark.   The walls are dry to the touch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The air is stale and the humidity is very low.  Every sound of your moves
seems to be magnified in this silent tunnel.  The tunnel apparently runs
to the south, and deep under the castle.  The floor seems to be heavy marble
and the walls are great pieces of quarried granite stone.</LongDescription>
