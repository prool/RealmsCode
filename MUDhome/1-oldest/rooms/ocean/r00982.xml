  <ShortDescription>You are in the massive entryway into the enormous cloud castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway you are in extends to the east.  The ceiling in the hall
is more than twenty meters straight up.  The walls and floor look like
they're just clouds, yet seem solid enough that you can stand on them.
A massive room lies to the east.</LongDescription>
