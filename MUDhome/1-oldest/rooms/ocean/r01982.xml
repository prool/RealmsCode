  <ShortDescription>You are in the Polearms Shop in Evander's World of Weapons center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see a number of large pole weapons on display here, including 
some strange ones you might not have seen before.  Most pole weapons
consist of a long, wooden pole, topped with a large metal blade.  
Variaties of the blades make some weapons better than others for 
certain types of battles.  </LongDescription>
