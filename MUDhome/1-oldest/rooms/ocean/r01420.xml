  <ShortDescription>You are in the access hallway for the guards and servants.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A door leads into the main dining hall.  The place appears to be fairly
busy as the maids rush around bringing dinner to the hungry people in
the hall.  You can see a stairway to the east that must lead up to
the main kitchen since that's where all the maids are coming from.</LongDescription>
