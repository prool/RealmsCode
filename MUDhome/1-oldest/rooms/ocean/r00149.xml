  <ShortDescription>You are on Taragon Road, near its southern end, between the wall and a pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A few steps north is the Deft Hand, a rather dark and dismal little place.
Immediately to the west is a tailor's shop, which advertises they can fit a
half-giant or an elf.  A number of nice looking capes are on display in the
window, and a couple of wizard's gowns are on display dummys.</LongDescription>
