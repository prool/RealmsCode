  <ShortDescription>You are in a room filled with constantly moving shadows.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mages who have pledged their allegiance to Prince Ragnar maintain a
weapons research room directly south of here, but be warned, if you go
in there, you will not be able to bring anything back out the one-way
portal you see at the south wall.  A cool breeze swirls through the
room as you stand here, and the shifting shadows occasionly show you
a skeleton hanging from chains on the wall.  The main armory is north.</LongDescription>
