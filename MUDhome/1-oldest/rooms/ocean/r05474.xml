  <ShortDescription>You are outside the massive gates of Prince Rutger's Castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a level lot with carts and wagons pulled up and waiting for their
owners.  A small door, for use after dark, is beside the huge gate.  Farther
north is an animal keep and stable.  On the west side of the wagon lot is a
strange device:  Looks like a tubular slide to take you to the bottom of the
mountain face so you won't have to travel down the road.</LongDescription>
