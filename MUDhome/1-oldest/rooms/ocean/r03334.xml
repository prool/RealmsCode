  <ShortDescription>You stand below the magnificent entrance to the Lyanden Tomb.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tomb floats quietly about three meters above ground.  White marble 
sheets and columns reflect the light of day quite beautifully, although your
vision is somewhat impaired by the chilly mist that has been following 
you around.  A crypt guardian hovers over the portico entrance to the 
tomb, so watch your step.</LongDescription>
