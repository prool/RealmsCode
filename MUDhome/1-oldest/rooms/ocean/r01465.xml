  <ShortDescription>You are in the main hallway on the second floor of the palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Something sure smells good up here.  It's probably coming from the 
kitchen to the east.  To the west, there is a door that is marked
"Guest".  Many of the visiting dignitaries are given temporary 
quarters for the duration of their stay here.  Being so close to
the kitchen, they can have their choice of what they want to eat
at any time of the day.</LongDescription>
