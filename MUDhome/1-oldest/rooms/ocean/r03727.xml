  <ShortDescription>You are in a suite reserved for members of Prince Ragnar's family.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This suite of rooms is reserved for members of his royal family and high
level aides who have pledged their allegiance to Prince Ragnar.  The new
owner of the Dragon Tooth Inn has made a public oath to stay neutral in
the dispute as to who should become the new king of Lyanden Castle.  After
the king died, both Prince Ragnar and Prince Rutger, once loving brothers,
lay claim to the Sceptre of Power, but the Mage Council withheld it until
its true owner could be determined.</LongDescription>
