  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Rosecrest Street, east of the Evenborough Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Evenborough Park seems out of place in the busy city, next to
the prime commercial districts to the south and west, and just across
the lake from the Lyanden Castle.  However, the park provides a serene
atmosphere for people to talk without being bothered.  This restful
meditation makes the citizens of the city much happier and therefore,
more productive.</LongDescription>
