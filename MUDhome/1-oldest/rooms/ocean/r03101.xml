  <ShortDescription>This is Tristram's Temple, on level two of the underground city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>True children of Tristram may rest here, where the palpable glow of
holiness will speed the healing of their wounds.  The beauty of this place
will also gladden their hearts.  Magnificent light green marble pillars
line the walls, rising up to a ceiling that is so high, it's lost in the
swirling mist.  A magical rope rises up from the floor into the mist, with
no end in sight.   o</LongDescription>
