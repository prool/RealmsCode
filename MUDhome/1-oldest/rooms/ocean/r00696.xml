  <ShortDescription>You are on Yellow Marsh Road, walking beside the cliffs near the river.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a modest cliff heading down into the river Othax.  Although
it is not that high up, it doesn't really look like it'd be an easy
climb either way.  The river is on the southern side of the road, and
eventually flows into the Lyanden Lake.</LongDescription>
