  <ShortDescription>You are on Tower Lane, just east of the Milsene Museum.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the museum appears to be west of here.  A tiny temple is
on the north side of the road, barely coming to your chest in height.  The
door is open, and you can see pixies and other small creatures inside.  On
the south side, next door to the museum, is a research center for a dwarven
mines and tunnels society.</LongDescription>
