  <Name>Mehetable's Yard</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the center yard of four huts, owned by Mehetable and her daughters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In front of each hut there is a very special apple tree, each bearing a
single remarkable apple.  Three of them are silver, and one of them is gold.
Mehetable and her three beautiful daughters don't mind the occasional
visitor helping themselves to an apple from the orchid, but one dares not
reach for one of these.</LongDescription>
