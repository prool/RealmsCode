  <Name>Archery Range</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the archery field where the elves learn to develop their
skills in bows and archery.  There are targets to the west and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large mesh prevents anyone from entering the range itself, as absolutely
no one is allowed in, for obvious reasons.  Unfortunately, the mesh is wide
enough that an arrow can easily go through it.  There are circular targets
about 50 meters to the west, and another set perhaps 25 meters south.
Elena's tackle shop is through the door.</LongDescription>
