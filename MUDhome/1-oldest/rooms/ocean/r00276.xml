  <ShortDescription>You are on the main path running through the mysterious Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The land looks like it's been turned upside down many times until just
rocks and dirt are left.  The strange place seems to lack just about
any sort of natural beauty, as if the gods just turned their back on the
area.  Oddly enough, no magic works in this area as well.</LongDescription>
