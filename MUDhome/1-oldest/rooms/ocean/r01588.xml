  <Name>Trees Above Etolos</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are high above the ground, in the trees overlooking Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is a rather common place for the higher level druids to meditate
and take in all that nature has to offer.  The druids take care of nature
and in turn, nature takes care of them.  The trees around the inner 
circle of Etolos are very tall and strong, being able to support many
people on their limbs.</LongDescription>
