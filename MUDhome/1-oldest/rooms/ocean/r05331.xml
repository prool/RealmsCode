  <ShortDescription>You are on Lyanden Road, just south of the old Valdune Watch Tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A meadow on the north side of the road is fenced and you see sheep and
goats grazing there.  There's no apparent entry to the tower from the road.
The ancient tower was once used as a signal station, one of many along
the way taken by invading trolls.  A fire atop the tower was the signal
to prepare for an invasion.</LongDescription>
