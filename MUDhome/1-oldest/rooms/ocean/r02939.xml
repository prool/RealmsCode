  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the front door to Khallazar's home on a rope canopy.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a bounce to your step as you walk on the criss-crossed ropes and
survey the house.  A sign over the door proclaims this to be the home of
Khallazar the Alchemist.  In smaller letters it says, "You bring the lead,
and I'll turn it into gold for a price."  You do have some lead in your
inventory, don't you?</LongDescription>
