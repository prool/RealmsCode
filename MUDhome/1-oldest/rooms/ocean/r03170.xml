  <Name>Lost in the Respitial Sea</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Smooth waves and a gray sky.  Its difficult to determine where one starts
and the other leaves off as you look at the horizon.  The sky and sea seem
to blend into one in all directions.  There is no land in sight, but you
have seen a few shark fins in the water occasionally.</LongDescription>
