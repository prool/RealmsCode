  <ShortDescription>A large mansion stands to the north.  Looks like it is boarded up.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Caledonia Road continues to the east and west, but the gate to the
mansion is north.  It doesn't look as if anyone has lived in the mansion
for quite some time, because it's windows are totally covered and all the
lights are completely out.  If you didn't know any better, you'd say it
was haunted.  Of course, every village has its mystery old house.</LongDescription>
