  <ShortDescription>Phexton Road continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A rather ornate little shop can be seen on the north side of the road. 
A sign over the door says a resident healer can make you well again, no
matter what condition you are in, as long as you can make it through the
door.  Next door to the healer is another little shop that seems to
specialize in Tarot cards for fortune tellers.  All manner of them are
on display.</LongDescription>
