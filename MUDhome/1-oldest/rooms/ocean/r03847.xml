  <ShortDescription>You are on the King's Northern Highway, north of a country inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south you can see a large but decrepit old inn where they serve
good food, or so the peasants along the road have said.  A few small
buildings and shops around the inn make up a village.  A produce stand
is just off the road.</LongDescription>
