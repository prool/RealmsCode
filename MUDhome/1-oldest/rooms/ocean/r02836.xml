  <ShortDescription>You are on the southern coast of the large, undergound lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Plasnelt Lake is a rather large body of water that somehow got trapped
below the surface of the glacier.  Surprisingly, the lake water is very
salty, as if it were ocean water.  Perhaps there is an underground
cavern to the ocean from here.</LongDescription>
