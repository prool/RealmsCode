  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the bottom of a brick cistern and see an aquaduct tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Water bubbles from a spring at your feet and flows into a dark tunnel to
the east.   The tunnel appears to form a brick lined aquaduct.  The water
is flowing in a steady stream in that direction, but not enough to fill
the tunnel.  You could wade into the aquaduct if you choose to go that way.</LongDescription>
