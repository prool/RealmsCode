  <ShortDescription>You have entered the sacred Etolian Druid's Shrine of Honesty.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have come upon the sacred Shrine of Honesty.  The druids honor six
basic virtues, and have built up a shrine for each of them.  This one
signifies honesty and the importance of honesty in the daily dealings
of life.  Without honesty, the world would be thrust into chaos and
honor would have no value.</LongDescription>
