  <ShortDescription>You are at two large, black gates leading into the Allisk Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Overland Drive passes by the entrance to the Allisk Manor here and 
continues to the northwest and southeast.  The gates have been locked
for ages and no one knows how to get in, not that anyone has really
tried, nor wanted to enter this place.  It has been rumored to be 
haunted by every known spirit that was ever believed not to exist
in the world.</LongDescription>
