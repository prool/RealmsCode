  <ShortDescription>You are in the cargo hold of the Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Pirates don't really carry cargo, but instead use this area to store
the loot they get from other ships.  The sick bay is south, toward the
stern, while the chief bosun has his quarters toward the bow.  A locked
door has the word "brig" crudely painted on it, and the rest of the hold
is filled with chests and barrels.  One keg has a candle sputtering on it.</LongDescription>
