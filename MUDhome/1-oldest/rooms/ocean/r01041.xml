  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceancrest Drive, between Hillcrest Drive and Regalia Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east, you can see the impressive Temple of the Rising Moon, run by a
clerical order which is dedicated to the balance of lunar power.  Since the
moon often symbolizes the hunt, many hunters come here before they leave the
city.  They seek the blessing of the goddess who resides in the temple.  To
the west is the famous Oceancrest Ministry of Knowledge.  This is the site
of the main Library and reference desk for nearly any researchable subject.
Of course, not just anyone can enter the Ministry.  It is a restricted to
only the wisest of scholars.  You probably don't qualify.</LongDescription>
