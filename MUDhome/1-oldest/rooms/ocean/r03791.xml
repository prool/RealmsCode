  <ShortDescription>You are on a sandy road connecting the beach area to Lelion Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road runs between high sand dunes on either side, making it difficult
to see very far at times.  When the winter storms lash this area, as they
do every year, they shift the sand and often uncover things that washed
ashore hundreds of years ago.  In the pubs there has been talk of finding
chests of jewels, and sometimes mysterious things with no apparent purpose.</LongDescription>
