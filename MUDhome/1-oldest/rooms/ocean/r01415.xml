  <ShortDescription>You are in a den containing a desk and a single bookshelf.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Keslar den is used as a small meeting place where people can meet in
privacy to conduct business.  There's a large desk in the exact center of
the room and a table with a flask of brandy.  The books on the bookshelf
appear to be just old ledgers showing the financial stability of the 
family.</LongDescription>
