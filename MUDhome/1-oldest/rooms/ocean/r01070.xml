  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, west of the Oceancrest Public Amphitheatre.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Amphitheatre is more like a large gathering party that
occurs daily around dusk.  The minstrels and bards entertain the people
while they talk and eat dinner after a long day's work.  Occasionally,
the administration will sponser concerts or other orchestral plays and
musicals to increase their waning revenues.</LongDescription>
