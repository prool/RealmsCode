  <ShortDescription>You are in the tree-lined yard in front of Hans Granovetter's Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the large old inn was hand-built by Granovetter the dwarf and his wife more
than a century ago.  They carried river stones from the Ramdes River which
is a little way further east of here.  The newer buildings were built by
their sons and daughters as the family grew, and now there is a thriving
little village starting to spread out near this bend in the North Highway.</LongDescription>
