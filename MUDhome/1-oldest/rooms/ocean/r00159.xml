  <ShortDescription>This is the eastern edge of the village, where Plasnelt Road ends.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Taragon Road runs north and south, and a militia armory is on the corner.
Long ago the wise village elders recognized the need for a militia, so they
set up a barracks and recruited the nastiest and meanest citizens they could
for the job.  The tradition has continued to this day.  However, knowing the
ways of drunken militia, they wisely put the armory at the opposite end of
town from the main barracks.</LongDescription>
