  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Main Street and Marina Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street runs west towards the Nylandian Bay and east towards the center
of the city.  Similarly, Marina Way also heads north towards the center of
town, but close to the Nylandian Port.  Going south will bring you near to
the Oceancrest Central Arena, where brave combatants battle to the death for
the amusement of spectators who can't get enough of the sight of blood.</LongDescription>
