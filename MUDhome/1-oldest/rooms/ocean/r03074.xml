  <Name>Temple Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret passage that connects the main chamber to private rooms.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are crushed doorways along the western side of the passage, which means
it would be impossible to enter them from this narrow tunnel.  Perhaps there
is another passage elsewhere in the Temple that would provide access.</LongDescription>
