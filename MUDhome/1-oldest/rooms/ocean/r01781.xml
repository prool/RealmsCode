  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, just south of the Shrine of Annam.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small, abandoned building on the north side of the road was recently
renovated by some rebellious believers as the Shrine of Annam.  Annam 
is the Great Creator of all life in the universe.  This believe was 
primarily believed only by the giants and half-giants of the realm, but
their word has spread to some of the other races, most notably including
humans.</LongDescription>
