  <ShortDescription>You are in a little used tunnel named after Thokkawilff, long dead now.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Over a hundred years ago, a master torturer lived down here below the main
castle.   He was in charge of a grusome dissection room and dungeon, and
eagerly awaited new victims.  (Although he was never known to smile.)  He 
died long ago, but his body was never removed from his quarters.  It wasn't
because they didn't want to remove the corpse, but because they couldn't
find it.</LongDescription>
