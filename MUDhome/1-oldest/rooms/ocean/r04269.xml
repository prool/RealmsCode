  <LongDescription>This is the stairway used by the castle's nobility.
Prince Rutger occasionally joins his friends who reside on the third level
and comes down this way, but he generally descends the east stairway which
is reserved for the royal family.  Immediately to the south you can see the
Grand Assembly.  On the east side, you see the room where the fallen may  
rescind their pledge to Prince Rutger.</LongDescription>
