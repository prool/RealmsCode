  <ShortDescription>You are in an alley behind the stores and shoppes along Hafnia Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is where most of the shoppes receive their inventories from the elves
in town who make such fine goods.  Of course, the caravans also deliver
their goods here too.  Some of the rarest and finest items in all of the
Land of Mordor are sold from the shoppes in Hafnia.</LongDescription>
