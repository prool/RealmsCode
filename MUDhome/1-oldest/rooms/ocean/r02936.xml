  <ShortDescription>You are on the east bank of the Ashton River, on a wide dirt road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Further north, the road has been washed out, but through the woods to
the east you can see a strange sight...  There's a house built on a canopy
of ropes strung between the trees!  It seems to be swaying gently in the
strong breeze coming from the mountains, creaking as it flexes on its odd
foundation.  A rope ladder hangs to the ground.</LongDescription>
