  <ShortDescription>You have walking along the main shopping district in Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elves of Hafnia are known for their trading.  To the north, you
see an armory.  To the south is a tavern for weary travelers to get
a cold beer.  For the first time, you look into the sky and notice
how clear it is.  Amazing how such a small community could thrive as
it does.</LongDescription>
