  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hofton Avenue, south of the Northern City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The City Walls rise nearly ten meters up from the ground you are walking
on, giving the city's guards a very good lookout into the wilderness and
deserts around Oceancrest.  On the south side of the road is the Red-Eye
Pub and Grill Stage, where various bards and minstrels go to practice in
front of an audience.</LongDescription>
