  <Name>Griffon's Heart Pub</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a low-ceilinged and poorly lighted pub which is rather cavernous.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This place is the favorite drinking spot for the lower level members of the
castle's fighting men and the female chamber maids who clean the castle's
rooms.  The low ceiling and dim light makes it hard to see very far, and the
room apparently stretches into darkness in a number of directions.  You hear
a lot of laughter from the dark corners.</LongDescription>
