depending on your orientation.  Going south it travels parallel to the City
Wall, which protects the city from the coastline of the Respitial Sea.  To
the southeast is an impressive building that was built in memory of one of 
early peacekeepers in the city.  The building is dedicated to Sir Millwood
of Uxtiva, and is now the residence of the present Mayor.</LongDescription>
