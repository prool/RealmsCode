  <ShortDescription>You are in the kitchen where food is prepared for the prisoners.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The kitchen is filthy.  Small rats run around grabbing pieces of meat
or what looks like meat (arguably) whenever they can.  The large pot
on the stove contains what looks like some sort of stew, but you can't
really tell what's in there, not that you'd really want to know.</LongDescription>
