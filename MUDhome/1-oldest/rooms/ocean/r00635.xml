  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Necropolis Avenue, west of Danielle's Mage Emporium.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Mistress Danielle Chanteclaire is one of the only arch-mages in Oceancrest
and has achieved this rank at but the mere age of 623, very young for a
grey elf.  There are only a handful of known arch-mages that ever existed
in the world.  This is usually very good because the power which comes with
this rank is also very powerful and manipulative.</LongDescription>
