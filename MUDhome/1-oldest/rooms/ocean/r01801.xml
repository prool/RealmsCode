  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, just north of the Shrine of Victory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Shrine of Victory, located south of the Melbourne Entertainment Arena,
symbolizes hope against impossible odds.  It is often visited by warriors
about to leave for battle, but otherwise generally ignored by most of the
other citizens.  On the north side of the road is the Melbourne Entertain-
ment Arena where contestants fight everything from common criminals to 
gladiators, and even lions.</LongDescription>
