  <ShortDescription>You are on Ivory Way, which runs north-south through the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small tree-lined park can be seen to the east, and a wall around the
Great Observatory is on the west.  Most people think there is only one
entrance to the Observatory which they point out as the one on Tiamat Lane.
But sometimes, early in the morning hours, the really big wigs who run that
place can be seen leaving the park, and nobody saw them go in there.</LongDescription>
