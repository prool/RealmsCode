  <ShortDescription>You are wandering down Nagaritha Drive, north of a small shopping complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The complex on the south provides much of the meat and grains to the
community as well as other essentials to day-to-day survival.  Directly
to the south is the Downtown Ice and Water Supply Facility where, obviously,
ice and water can be purchased for storage of meats and, of course, a 
nice cool glass of iced tea.</LongDescription>
