  <ShortDescription>You are in a large questioning room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The people in the dungeon aren't as friendly as the people in town.  You
are in a small questioning room where prisoners are asked to answer a
number of questions.  Failure to do so may result in punishment.  By the
looks of the weapons on the wall, you don't really want to know what
that punishment is.</LongDescription>
