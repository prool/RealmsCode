  <LongDescription>Many of the new ideas and concepts which basic research produces are turned
into usable products by the factories on this street.  On the east side
you see a bright green building and a sign which says they specialize in
enchanted rods and staves.  They proudly state that they use only the latest
spells in production.</LongDescription>
