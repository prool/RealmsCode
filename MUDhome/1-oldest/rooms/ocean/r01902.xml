  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Central Arena is not a place for the weak-natured, weak-
stomached or weak-of-heart.  It is divided into three major Arenas:
the Central Arena, where players engage in hand-to-hand combat with
various gladiators and other fighters for victory and glory.  The map
shows the various degrees of difficulty in the arena.  The Pits of Doom
are holding pens for large dragons.  These should not be tampered with
without extreme care.  Dragons enjoy gladiators for lunch or at least a
light snack before dinner.  The Game Arena is the largest of them all
which combines skill and strategy to defeat the Wizard of Kaldais.</LongDescription>
