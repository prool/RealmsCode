  <Name>Mountain Trail to the Palace</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the winding trail up the strange mountain towards the Palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trail up the mountain is not quite as treacherous as you had first
imagined.  Nonetheless, danger lurks everywhere.  As you head further
south, you can start to make out the features of the large palace 
sitting on top the mountain.  The Palace appears to be magically kept
in place since it would otherwise collapse and fall down the mountain.</LongDescription>
