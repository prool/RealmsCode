  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of the basement hallway in the Palace of Keslar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway forms to the east and south of here.  You can see to the
east of you a door leading into what appears to be guards quarters.
With the large number of guards you have seen wandering the halls in
this area, you figure that's probably a good guess.</LongDescription>
