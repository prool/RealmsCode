  <ShortDescription>You are about as far east as the dragon wants to fly.  90.n0.e24.s9.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can feel the great dragon veering away from any turns to the east.
Below you are valleys and streams which cut through the oaks and pines
of the Kista Forest.  There doesn't seem to be anything to the east but
more of the same, while somewhere to the north is the city of Kista.</LongDescription>
