  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lorian Parkway, east of the Shrine of Truth &amp; Fairness.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road is Jeane's Glass and Glazing shop, where you
can pick up all kinds of fancy and interesting glass objects, for windows,
doors, or whatever.  Glass, however, is very expensive, and should be used
sparingly.  On the west side of the road is the Paladin's Shrine of Truth
and Fairness.  The entrance to the shrine is located off of Islandia Drive
to the south.</LongDescription>
