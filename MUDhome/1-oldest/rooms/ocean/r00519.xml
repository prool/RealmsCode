  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of Marina Circle, near Nylandian Bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hillborough Way runs east from the Circle, heading towards the center
of town.  There are a number of small monuments around dedicated to the
sailors and shipmen who were lost at sea.  On the southeastern corner,
you can see the Temple of Ahto, the God of the Oceans and the Sea.  Just
ahead to the west, you can also see the Temple of Poseidon, a Greek God
of the Sea.  Superstitious sailors pray to both gods, but most are fond
of just one.</LongDescription>
