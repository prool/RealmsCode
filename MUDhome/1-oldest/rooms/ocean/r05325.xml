  <Name>Lyanden Road/Timarask Valley</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on Lyanden Road, near the northern end of Timarask Valley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Timarask Valley is generally shown on maps as a place to avoid.  Rain is
a constant force in this small valley, blown down from Mount Aphinix over
to the east.  There is almost a funnel effect, with the rain and wind all
converging on this short valley.  You might ask why the road builders came
this way, but you would learn that other ways are worse.</LongDescription>
