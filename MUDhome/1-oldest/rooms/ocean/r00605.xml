  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Avatar Boulevard, just west of the Ruins entrance.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large building opens up into the wonderous Avatar Ruins, a virtually
desolate place where the world has more or less just opened up.  Various
pieces of rock and debris lie scattered about.  The Ruins are said to 
hold a number of secrets about the past and the future, but no one has
really ever been able to figure them out.</LongDescription>
