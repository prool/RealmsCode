  <LongDescription>The large Chateau Richland Grape Orchard to the west provides much of 
the refreshments in the means of wine and juice to the city.  The Chateau
produces the finest Bordeaux wines in the land, and a bottle can run
upwards of two or three gold pieces.  You can hear some light cheering
from the inside of the Melbourne Entertainment Arena, to the east.  The
entrance to the Arena is located off of Nagaritha Drive, to the south.</LongDescription>
