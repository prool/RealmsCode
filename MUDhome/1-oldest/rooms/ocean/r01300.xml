  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Hofton Avenue and Riverdell Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Riverdell Way runs south out of the intersection with Hofton Avenue, which
continues to the east and west, running parallel to the northern City Walls.
To the southwest, you can see a large forest area that appears to continue
as far down Riverdell Way that you can see.  The large forest seems 
undisturbed by the passage of time and the development of the city.</LongDescription>
