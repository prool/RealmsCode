  <ShortDescription>This is a dirty little bar run by a dirty little dwarf.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rum is the only thing they sell, so if you want to drink anything else
you had best be going.  Besides, why did the music stop when you came in?
A lot of sullen looks seem to be directed toward you, and you notice a
couple of young dwarves over at the side appear to be fingering their
knives.  A snot-nosed and giggling troll seems to have blocked the exit.</LongDescription>
