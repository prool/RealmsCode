  <ShortDescription>You are inside the east gate for the City of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gates close at night and and open at sunrise.  Many have been the
cries heard outside during the blackness of night, but the guards here
will never open the gates for fear that the mountain trolls will be out
there.  If you decide to make the journey outside, be aware that you cannot
come back at night.</LongDescription>
