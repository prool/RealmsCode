  <ShortDescription>You are in a wonderfully charming valley, filled with ancient oaks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path seems well worn, but also well maintained.  Wildflowers grow in
neat borders along the way.  Looking west you see that the path splits
and takes a southern route and also a northern one.  Both paths seem
equally well taken care of.  Great oaks make a dense woods in that
direction, and you see small homes cut into some of them.</LongDescription>
