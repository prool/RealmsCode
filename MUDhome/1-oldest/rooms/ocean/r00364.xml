  <ShortDescription>You are on a wide and comfortable veranda of a big, red painted house.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The main room is through the wide entry to the north, while a broad and
winding stairway goes to the upstairs area of the house.  Several women
and rough looking men are in animated conversations around you, and a 
small dwarf makes his way through the crowd carrying a tray of drinks.</LongDescription>
