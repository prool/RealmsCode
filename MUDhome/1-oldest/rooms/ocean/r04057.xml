  <Name>Back Yard of Granovetter's Inn</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the yard behind Granovetter's Inn, near several small buildings.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small village is called Granovetter's Corner by people who live in
this region, and they often prefer to do business here rather than go clear
into the big city of Oceancrest.  There is a blacksmith here who can fix
most anything, and a no-questions-asked pawn shop.</LongDescription>
