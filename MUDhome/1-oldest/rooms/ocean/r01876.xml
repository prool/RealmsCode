  <ShortDescription>An old woman stands up from her desk and asks how she might help you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>All new members must come to this office before the goddess Artemis will
accept them.  The old lady tells you that the main chapel is located to
the northwest down the main hall.  In the chapel, the pulpit is towards
the north and the prayer chamber is to the south.  The door in the 
hallway to the north leads to the priestess' chambers, where she would
be willing to train you in the ways of Artemis.</LongDescription>
