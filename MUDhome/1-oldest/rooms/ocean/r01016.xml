  <Name>Main Street/Netherworld Lane Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Main Street and Netherworld Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Netherworld Lane is aptly named because it passes just north of the entrance
to the Oceancrest Necropolis.  Netherworld Lane spans the width of the City
of Oceancrest, from the Bay in the west to the City Walls on the east side.
Main Street travels from north to south, and passes through major shopping
districts.  From here, the Nylandian Bay is actually northwest.</LongDescription>
