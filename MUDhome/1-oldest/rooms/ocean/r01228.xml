  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along Lankshire Parkway, north of Waterfront Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lankshire Parkway runs between the Klondike Wheat Fields on the east side
of the road and the DeNail Corn Fields, on the west side of the road.
To the south, you can see Waterfront Way intersecting Lankshire Parkway.
Both the corn and wheat fields are more than happy to provide unskilled
labor with some temporary jobs, plowing fields and scaring away the vermin
that poison their crops.</LongDescription>
