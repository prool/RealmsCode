  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, just east of the West Wall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the West Wall just beyond Rosecrest Street to the west.  On
the south side of the road, you can see the Oceancrest Ministry of Truth.
The Ministry of Truth spends most of its time verifying that what is true
is true and what is false is false.  Unfortunately, what one person thinks
as true is seldom what another believes is true, thus everything in 
creation is both true and false.  </LongDescription>
