  <ShortDescription>This is the back lot where the carnival's performers and animals stay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From here you might go visit the carnival's cook wagon which is parked to
the south.  The carny workers say the food is actually quite good.  The
animal wagon is to the west, and you hear roars and strange sounds coming
from that direction.  There are some really strange animals over there.
If you go northwest you will be in the carnival's backstage area where 
the performer's gather between acts.</LongDescription>
