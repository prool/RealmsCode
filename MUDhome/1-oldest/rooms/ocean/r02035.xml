  <LongDescription>On the northeast side of the road is the magnificient Cathedral of Veratus.
The Cathedral was built at the time of Randolf the Blue against the wishes
of his council, but since the monks paid their taxes, they were allowed to
build it anyway.  The main entrance is a little way to the east, on the
south side of the road.</LongDescription>
