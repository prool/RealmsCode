  <Name>Old Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in an abandoned section of the tunnels below the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several great oaken doors are wedged tightly shut on the west side of
the tunnel.  The entry to the first one is overgrown with a gelatinous
slime that seems to quiver as you get closer.  A number of skeleton
bones lie just below it, and several rusted pieces of armor lie on the
tunnel floor.  Further south you hear the trickling sound of water.</LongDescription>
