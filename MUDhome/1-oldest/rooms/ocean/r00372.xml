  <Name>Jungle Cemetery</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a small cemetery in the jungle, near a freshly opened grave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A coffin has been pulled from the ground and hacked open, the wreckage
strewn under the large trees.  The ground is still steaming, and a freshly
killed chicken lies on top of the casket, its blood used to write unusual
symbols there.  A string of chicken entrails look to be carefully placed
in a circle around the wooden casket, and a single candle still burns atop
it.  Thick jungle brush separates you from an area where you hear chanting.</LongDescription>
