  <Name>Goblin Priest's Sleeping Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the living quarters of the goblin priests.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is divided into two parts by a heavy cloth curtains which run the
length of the room.  On one side of the room are cots arranged in rows along
side each other, and on the wall behind each cot is a heavy ceremonial
robe hanging on a hook.  At the foot of each bed is a small wooden chest,
presumably where a goblin priest stores his meager possessions.  On the
other side of the room are tables and chairs and the remains of a recent
meal.  On the wall is a grusome painting of a goblin diety devouring his
foes, surrounded by his priestly servants.</LongDescription>
