  <ShortDescription>You are in the once-grand southern hallway of Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This was actually the feasting hall where the duke's men joined him around
his table.  Many were the parties that lasted till dawn in this room after
a successful hunt in the forest of Kista.  It was in this very hall that
the Witch murdered the duke and his family.  Now it is ashes.</LongDescription>
