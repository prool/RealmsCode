  <ShortDescription>You are in a misty glen, with a soft fog curling around your feet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The air is almost a pastel blue, and the haze softens your vision as
you look around the glen.  The fog at your feet flows gently across the
ground, and is as white as glistening snow.  There is movement at the
edge of the glen, but it's hard to make out what's causing it.</LongDescription>
