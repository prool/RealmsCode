  <ShortDescription>You are in the famous (or infamous) Treasure Maps and Accessories Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Adventures Unlimited is a franchise service which buys and sells treasure
maps and other artifacts for the treasure hunter.  Although they have
a reputation for being reputable, no one has ever seemed to survive long
enough to find the treasure they claim to have bought a map to.  Whether
or not treasure exists probably depends on the skill of the purchaser,
and not the reputability of the seller.</LongDescription>
