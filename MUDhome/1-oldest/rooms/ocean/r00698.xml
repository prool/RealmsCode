  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Yellow Marsh Road, just south of the Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The odd Avatar Ruins are said to hold mysterious secrets about the lives
of the ancient gods, and even said to prove that they exist.  Apperently,
there was a great clash between the gods of the universe, and they used
this planet to fight out their differences.  Most people no longer believe
this theory, but still marvel at the mysterious Avatar Ruins.</LongDescription>
