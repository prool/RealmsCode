  <ShortDescription>You are in the cellar of the Oceancrest Orphanage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is dark and musty, with a strong smell of soap and dirty clothes.
Clutter abounds, and the floor is covered with boxes and stacks of odd
items.  When kids are brought to the orphanage, most of the stuff they
had with them is placed down here, out of the way.  The only person who
ever comes down here, though, is a nasty old caretaker whom the children
fear and hate.  They tell tales to anyone who will listen that he has
turned bad children into soap, by rendering them in a large vat down here.</LongDescription>
