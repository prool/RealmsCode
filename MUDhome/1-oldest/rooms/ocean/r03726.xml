  <ShortDescription>You are in the second floor hallway of the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway is richly carpeted and dimly lighted.  Light comes from under
the doors of several of the rooms, but all of the doors are closed.  The
sound of your feet is lost in the thick pile of the new carpeting.  To 
the east is the top of the stairway, while further to the west the hallway
seems to intersect another hallway.</LongDescription>
