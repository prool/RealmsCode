  <LongDescription>This is the western end of a short mountain valley leading east/west.
to the southwest the road spirals lower through a field of old lava flows.
The peak directly to the south is an active volcano, although it is not 
doing anything at the moment except putting out a little smoke.  East are
the towering peaks of the Hafnia Mountain Range.</LongDescription>
