  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lelion Way, around the back side of a large complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It looks like a large shopping center, but you're on the wrong side of
the complex to enter it.  On the south, you can see a sign which reads
"Deni's World of Spices".  To the north, you can see (and smell) the
Lyanden Swamp, a mushy wasteland of useless land.</LongDescription>
