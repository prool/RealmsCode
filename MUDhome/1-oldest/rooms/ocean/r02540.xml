  <ShortDescription>You are no longer in this world.  There is a red haze surrounding you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's almost like a luminescent fog, making it impossible for you to see
even your hand when you put it in front of your eyes.  It's neither warm
nor cold however, but it is as silent as a tomb.  The only thing that draws
your attention is an area in the haze that is slightly more intense in
the color red than its surroundings.  You might try going that way.</LongDescription>
