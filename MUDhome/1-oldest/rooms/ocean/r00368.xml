  <ShortDescription>You are in a clearing between the village and a thick tropical jungle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The beach is not far from here, and a road is cut through the jungle which
seems to go in the direction of the sound of the surf.  Tall palms and
heavy banana trees are overhead, and the ground is covered with soft ferns
and creeping vines.  The back doors of several buildings open onto this
cleared area, and garbage has been thrown into heaps nearby.</LongDescription>
