  <ShortDescription>You are in the main southern hallway in the Palace of Keslar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The southern hall continues to the east.  The west hallway has formed
to the north and a small guard's hall is to the south.  As you have
been surveying the palace, you notice that the mages have accomplished
much more in the ways of technology than the humans in Brownhaven.  You
are astonished by the grandeur and sophistication of such a place.</LongDescription>
