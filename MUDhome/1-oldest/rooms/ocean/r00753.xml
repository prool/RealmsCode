  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Wakeforest Drive and Lelion Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lelion Way runs east and west out of the intersection with Wakeforest
Drive, which continues to the north and south.  On both sides to the south
of the intersection, there is some thick brush that prevents you from
seeing into what appears to be a small park.  There appear to be a couple
of shops and facilities to the north along Wakeforest Drive.</LongDescription>
