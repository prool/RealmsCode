  <ShortDescription>You are in a small arena with a single opponent gladiator as your foe.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The ultimate test of a warrior's ability is their ability to stand up 
to a single gladiator in a one-on-one, hand-to-hand, battle to the 
death combat.  Not just anyone can do such a feat, but there's no 
shame in a proud fight to the death.  A quick escape back into the
Preparation Room is not available as the door to the room has been
sealed from the opposite side.</LongDescription>
