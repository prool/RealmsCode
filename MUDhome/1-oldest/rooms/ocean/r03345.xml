  <ShortDescription>You are circling the Necropolis on a well tended path.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A gravel path and a grass covered walkway converge at this point on
the grounds.  To the northwest there is one of several entrances to
the commoners' cemetery.  Inside that area are a great many simple
headstones and inset plaques, all on a well tended grassy hill.  A
crew of gardners and a few grave diggers are taking a break under a
tree, eating something odd.</LongDescription>
