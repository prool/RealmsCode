  <ShortDescription>You are in a large cave-like structure that smells of wet fur.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have wandered into the deadly realm of the dreaded werewolves.  Some are
a little tougher than others, but they will all try to convert you to their
way of thinking with a poisonous bite.  The path leads deeper into the cave
if you go west, but back out to the manor entrance if you go east.</LongDescription>
