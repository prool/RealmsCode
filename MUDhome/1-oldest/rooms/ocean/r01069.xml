  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, which runs parallel to the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large City Walls on the west of Rosecrest Street are a constant 
reminder of the engineering technological superiority of the city.  No
other city boasts such a wall, nor such an elite security force.  On
the east of Rosecrest is the lawn section of the Oceancrest Public
Amphitheatre, where visiting bards and minstrels will entertain the
people, usually around dusk, and hoping for a few pieces of gold.</LongDescription>
