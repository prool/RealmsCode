  <ShortDescription>You are crawling along a narrow passage that is pitch dark.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This part of the passage is much wider than the part going east,
but it's still only big enough for two.  There is a sound of a rusty
door being moved coming from the north.  The sound isn't constant, but
comes and goes.  It's difficult to stand in here, and you certainly
wouldn't want to get in a fight in this cramped space.</LongDescription>
