  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Netherworld Lane, north of the Riverdell Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Riverdell Tranquility Park, aptly named, is one of the quieter, more
peaceful parks in the city, primarily because it is so large.  There is 
more than enough room in the park for everyone's interests without having
to bother someone else.  The park is also used to train Rangers in the ways
of tracking and searching in the woods, without having to actually leave
the safety of Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
