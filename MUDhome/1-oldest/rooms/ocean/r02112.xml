  <ShortDescription>You are at the western end of Mehetable's Apple Orchid.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are rows and rows of gnarled old apple trees, each loaded with
beautuful fruit.  The earth is rich and freshly turned, and not a weed
in sight.  Mehetable the Witch takes good care of her orchid.  Farther
to the east you see four huts surrounding some very special apple trees.
Lelion Way is just outside a small wooden fence on the north.</LongDescription>
