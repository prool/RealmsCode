  <ShortDescription>You are in the southern end of a large pit about fifty meters wide.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Sporting Pit allows barbarians and their kind to experiment with
new weapons and armors in battles with outsiders or other worthy 
barbarian opponents.  You are in the higher of the two pits, the other
lying to the north, more depressed into the landscape.  Less barbarians
wander into this pit than into the deeper one to the north.</LongDescription>
