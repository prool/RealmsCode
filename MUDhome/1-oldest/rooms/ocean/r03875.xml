  <Name>Ulandian Temple Entry</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing near the ruined entry to the great Ulandian temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The temple is completely overgrown with jungle vines and plants, and all
you can see is where the entry used to be before massive stones fell from
above and sealed it.  Looks like an earthquake caused the top of the temple
to tumble down on the rest of it.  Maybe that's why its abandoned now.
Not too far to the east you can see the waters of the Respitial Sea out
over a sea cliff.  The jungle seems to come to an end there.  At one time
this temple probably had a fantastic view of the ocean, since it is built
on a high cliff overlooking the beach below.</LongDescription>
