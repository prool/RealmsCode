  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, taking in the surrounding scenery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>With the exception of the massive City Walls on the southern side of the
street, there isn't much to actually look at in this part of the town.  
On the north side of the street are the small houses of the farmers and
their families.  These were built more or less because the residential
buildings were too far away and the farmers enjoy complaining to the
city government.</LongDescription>
