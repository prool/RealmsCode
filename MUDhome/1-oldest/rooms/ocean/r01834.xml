  <ShortDescription>You are walking along one of the central paths through the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Barbarian Pits were more or less carved out of the surrounding country
to suit the needs of the half-giants who live here.  To the north, you can
see the small Trading Post where some of the richer barbarians can trade or
buy better armors to wear instead of the loincloths most are sporting.</LongDescription>
