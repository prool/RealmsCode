  <ShortDescription>You find yourself under a strange berry bush with a number of bees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The bees don't really bother you if you leave them alone.  Your ranger
tracking skills are improving with each level.  If your goal is to train,
you should enter the hole below the small shrub.  If you wish to leave the
park, go out.  If you wish to remain in the park, you must track out of 
here.</LongDescription>
