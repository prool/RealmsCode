  <ShortDescription>You are on the Necropolis path, passing a large grove of trees to the
southwest and the mausoleum to the east.   Its power can be felt by 
archmages even from outside the Necropolis.   The entire building has
a red aura to it, so it might be best to stay away.</ShortDescription>
