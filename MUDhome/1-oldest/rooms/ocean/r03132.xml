  <ShortDescription>You are on East Uland Way, not far from the bluffs dropping into the sea.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Calling this a street would be a real travesty, since its mostly a mud path,
but there are a number of small businesses along here.  A few cottages can
be seen further back in the thick jungle brush.  If you look eastward, you
can see the bluffs which rise above the Respitial Sea.  Looking to the south
is a strip of land with a few brightly colored tents on it.  Looks like a
flea market from the number of people carrying odd looking stuff.</LongDescription>
