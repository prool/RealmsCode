  <Name>Old Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a part of the network of tunnels deep beneath the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Many of the tunnels down here look like they are regularly traveled and
maintained, but not this section.  Cobwebs are thick and small animals
scurry out of your way, although once or twice a couple of them held their
ground longer than usual before slowly retreating into dark recesses.
Beneath your feet is an iron grate and you can hear water trickling down
below.  There is a wretched smell coming from the south.</LongDescription>
