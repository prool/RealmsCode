  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, just south of Regalia Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east is the magnificent Shrine of the Protectors.  Although there is
no particular clerical order which oversees the shrine, it is maintained at
public expense for all the citizens of Oceancrest.  They may come to pray or
ask for protection from whatever god they happen to belive in.  It all comes
out the same, right?  To the west is the Oceancrest Public Amphitheatre,
a place where bard and minstrels entertain.  The entrance is located on
either Regalia Drive or Nagaritha Drive.</LongDescription>
