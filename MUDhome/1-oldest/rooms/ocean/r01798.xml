  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, north of the Bow &amp; Arrow shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small business that calls itself Bows &amp; Arrows Unlimited does pretty good
work for the price and supplies a number powerful bows and various 
ammunition to go with it.  Most of the bows are elven in nature, many of
which were made next door at Ian's Fletchery.  On the north side of the 
road you can see the Uland Repair Shop.  Entrances to both shopping centers
are located off of Riverdell Way.</LongDescription>
