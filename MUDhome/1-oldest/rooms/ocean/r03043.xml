  <ShortDescription>You are in a room dedicated to seeing how long you can live.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not to your old age of course, but to how long you can live with most of
your blood removed, or how long you can live with your heart and stomach
surgically exposed to the open air.  A stone slab with cuffs and belts is
the centerpiece of the room, and sharp instruments of all sorts hang on a
wall behind you.  Scattered on a table close by are tubes and needles, and
someone has thoughtlessly tossed the cut-off top of a skull there, still
matted with bloody hair.</LongDescription>
