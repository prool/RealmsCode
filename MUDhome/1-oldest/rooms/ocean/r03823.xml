  <ShortDescription>You are standing precariously on the right platform, high above the Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Perched high above the ground, you stand amidst trapeze artists waiting
their turn to perform.  They make swinging through the air, doing flips and
dives, look like children playing on a swing.  You would probably not have a
problem getting to the main platform if you jumped with some effort and held
on tight.  A tiny ladder is attached to the post supporting the platform.
Directly below, clowns and acrobats perform in the small ring.</LongDescription>
