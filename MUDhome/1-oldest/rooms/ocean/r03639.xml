  <ShortDescription>This is the main armory for Prince Ragnar's troops.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hanging from the rafters you see all manner of armors and hoods, and
in all sizes, too.  One corner seems to be devoted to leather while
another contains only mithrill.  Directly above you hangs a knight's
full suit of chain mail, and a variety of hoods.  A rack along the 
wall is filled with shields bearing the crest of Ragnar, and a counter
top is covered with leggings and gloves.  A great hot forge can be 
seen in the room to the east, while the room on the west appears to
be used to manufacture archery tackle.</LongDescription>
