  <LongDescription>The Rodaisl Community Housing Complex is one of two community housing 
complexes in Oceancrest.  The Rodaisl Complex is much larger than the 
Obidian Complex, located off of Wakeforest Drive, and has room for nearly
fifteen thousand people, or roughly four thousand apartments that can
house up to four people each.  On the south side of the road, you can see
the Riverdell Tranquility Park, where people usually go to relax after a
long day of work.</LongDescription>
