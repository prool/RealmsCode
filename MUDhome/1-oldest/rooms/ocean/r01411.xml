  <ShortDescription>You are inside a small shack used by the gardener.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Unfortunately, there's no gardener here right now.  He's probably out
in the garden cleaning up.  The shack apperently has nothing fancy
in it besides some hoes and shovels which could be used as weapons
if you got desperate.  The gardener won't like you taking his supplies
from him, though.</LongDescription>
