  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Orchard Lane, north of the Healer's Eye.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Healer's Eye is a small healing shop on the south side of the road.
The healers there will help you recover from whatever accidents or battles
you might have been in, and do not charge for their services.  On the 
north side of the road is the Brunskid Trader's Guild, a place where many
goods trade hands, some of questionable origin.</LongDescription>
