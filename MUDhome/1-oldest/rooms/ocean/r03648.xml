  <ShortDescription>You are in a pitch-black tunnel below Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel is wide enough that you cannot touch both walls at the same time.
The tunnel is hot, and water condenses on the ceiling.  The drops run down
your back, making you shiver.  Or is it the water?</LongDescription>
