  <ShortDescription>This is the entry for the castle's armory and weaponsmith's workshop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large room to the south is the main storage for Prince Ragnar's troops.
Several of the kingdom's best weaponsmiths and armormasters work there,
and quiet whispers in the castle say there are a number of experienced
mages doing research on new weapons in a secret laboratory area behind the
armory.  Perhaps that explains the reason you feel the charge of magic
in the air.</LongDescription>
