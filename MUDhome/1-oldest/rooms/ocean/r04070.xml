  <ShortDescription>You are on a steep path above the North Highway, west of the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look below you, you see that rocks and boulders have been rolled
across the King's North Highway.  It's evident, though, that road crews
have been working on the problem, as you can see where they have setup
a camp and have brought in equipment to clear the road.  To the west is 
an icy path, leading to a cold looking mountain.</LongDescription>
