  <ShortDescription>You are in a gulley which a stream of water has cut across the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stream flows from the Enchanted Forest on the north side and has cut
the road on its way to the desert on the south side.  Within a few meters,
the water disappears into a great sinkhole in the desert floor.  The stream
swirls violently with a loud roar before going under the sand.</LongDescription>
