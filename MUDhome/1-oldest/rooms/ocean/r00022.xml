  <ShortDescription>You are in a small park just south of Plasnelt Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Trees and nicely trimmed bushes form a nice park where you may sit and
contemplate your existance in this Land of Mordor.  An old mage, white 
bearded and ugly, sits on a park bench, looking you over.  He looks like 
he would like to talk, if you have the time.  He wears a warm looking 
cloak, evidently stuffed with a great many things.</LongDescription>
