  <ShortDescription>You are in a dusty sitting room upstairs in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a stale quality to the air, as though the room had not been open
for a long time.  This is the living quarters of the previous owner of the
inn.  A small kitchen and two bedrooms can be seen in adjoining rooms, but
they are as silent and musty as this one.  After the owner was hanged, his
body was returned here in a body bag, similar to the one you see on the
floor now, to await reclaimation by relatives.</LongDescription>
