  <LongDescription>Danielle Chanteclaire is one of the only living archmages in all of
Oceancrest.  Not many people ever reach the status of archmage, and, in
fact, there have only been ten archmages in all of history.  Only two
are living today, which is quite amazing in itself.  Ironically, most
of the archmages are still "alive" in the form of liches.</LongDescription>
