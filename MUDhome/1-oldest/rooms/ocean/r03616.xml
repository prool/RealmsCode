  <ShortDescription>You are in the northwest corner of the main courtyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The interior wall of the castle is covered with a rambling grape vine which
was growing here when the castle was built centuries ago.  Some of the vines
are as thick as a man's arm, providing a good handhold for anyone adventure-
some enough to want to climb them.  A small booth has been set up here, and
a bright canopy flies above it.  The vendor seems to be selling charms 
against evil spirits and ghosts.  A small sign says he will also buy your 
charms and amulets.</LongDescription>
