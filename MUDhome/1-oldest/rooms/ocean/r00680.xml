  <ShortDescription>You are on Hofton Avenue, walking on the north side of the Stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Stables are provided for guests to leave their steeds
while visiting the city.  Horses can be dangerous to pedestrians walking
along the streets.  Furthermore, the people on the streets can frighten
the horses, causing them to hurt themselves.  For this reason, the city
asks that visitors leave their horses in the provided stables.</LongDescription>
