  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, which runs east to west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of Hillcrest Drive is the Ministry of Truth building
where everyone in the building insists that everyone else in the building
is in fact lying.  In their attempt to figure out what is true, they
have stumbled upon the problem that truth is what one makes it out to
be, therefore nothing is true, but then again, nothing is false.  </LongDescription>
