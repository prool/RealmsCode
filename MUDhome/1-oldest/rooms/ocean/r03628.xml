  <ShortDescription>You are directly south of the great statue of King Lyanden.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Further south is a tranquil rest area surrounded by trees and a hedge.
This part of the courtyard is often used as an area for falcon training,
and falconeers come here to show off and trade their birds of prey.  A
coop of pigeons stands off to the side, with a number of unsuspecting
birds inside.  A hedge blocks the way to the east, but looking west you
can see the castle's garden.</LongDescription>
