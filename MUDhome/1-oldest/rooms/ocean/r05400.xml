  <ShortDescription>You are on a country road just north of a major intersection of roads.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are pleasant sounds from the forest around you, and although the
trees appear thick and forbidding, everything looks normal enough.  The
road could use a little work, as it seems the winter's rain has left its
mark and cut a few channels across it.</LongDescription>
