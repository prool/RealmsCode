  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, south of the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the Dragon Tooth Inn is to the north of here.  The
small path leads up past a small fountain into the reception area.  
There is a very nice bar and other more expensive items to be found in
such a lavish establishment.  It is always crawling with city guard 
patrols as well as their own security force.  Oceanview Drive is to
the west of here.</LongDescription>
