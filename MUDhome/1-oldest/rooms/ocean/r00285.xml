  <ShortDescription>You are on the outer path circling around the Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path comes unusually close to the mountain-like object you have been
walking around.  It appears to just come out of the ground, with no
granularity at all.  The sharp peaks and edges make the mountain look
unclimbable, but you do see some niches in the mountain.</LongDescription>
