  <ShortDescription>You are walking along a gold and silver corridor west of the lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The majestic cavern is quite odd to see in such a strange place, especially
with the lake full of sahuagin and trolls nearby.  Nevertheless, the hall
exists, but doesn't travel very far.  To the west, you can see a massive
door covered with even more gemstones and jewels.  There is a strange,
diamond and emerald lock on the door.</LongDescription>
