  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, just north of the Iilandi Estate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Iilandi Estate was build only a few decades ago.  The Iilandi
Family earned most of its wealth by managing and maintaining the Richland
Grape Orchard and the Klondike Wheat Fields, both very prosperous ventures.
Both sites produce enough food for most of the town to survive comfortably,
and the excess gets exported to other, less well-off cities.</LongDescription>
