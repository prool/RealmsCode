  <ShortDescription>This is Main Street, the center of most of the activities in Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One of the most attractive entertainment centers in the entire village is
the Sportsman's Arena, located just to the west.  A great banner across
the top indicates there are three arenas going at all times, even one for
the kids.  It's a family affair, with door prizes and a set of dishes to
the lucky winner.</LongDescription>
