  <ShortDescription>You are on Randolf Lane, leading into the wondrous city of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The city of Kista has a relatively short history as it was built on the
ruins of the empire of Randolf the Blue.  The city operates as the center
of the Triad of Wisdom, representing the three major races in the Land of
Mordor.  Together, the elves, humans and dwarves built this city to be a
depository of all knowledge.  The faerie folk added their touch, as well.</LongDescription>
