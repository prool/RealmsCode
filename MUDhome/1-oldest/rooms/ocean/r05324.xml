  <ShortDescription>You are at the northern end of Timarask Valley, which runs to the southeast.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Heavy rain and gusts of wind soak you and bend you near double.  It's very
hard to see very far in either direction.   To the west the rain appears to
be a mere shower, while deeper in the valley you see it is almost a storm.
Experienced travelers tell of stormhawkes which live in the rainstorms.</LongDescription>
