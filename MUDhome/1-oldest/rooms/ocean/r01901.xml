  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Central Arena is divided into a number of smaller 
arenas and combat zones for the pleasure of the viewing audience.  To
the southeast is the Central Arena, where combatants engage strong
opponents in hand-to-hand combat.  The Central Arena is divided into
many small areas of individual skill including a one-on-one combat
arena.  To the southwest are the Pits of Doom.  The Pits are heavily
guarded at all times and house a number of large dragons.  To the
north is the Game Arena, where combatants use wit and skill to eventually
defeat the great Wizard of Kaldais.  </LongDescription>
