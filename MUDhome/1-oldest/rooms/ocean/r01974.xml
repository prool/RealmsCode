  <ShortDescription>You are in a large terrerium where numerous pets are kept on display.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This large room is surrounded by glass and protected from the outside
world.  Oddly, you have found yourself curious about the animals in
the room and have foolishly entered.  The large scorpions and spiders
probably think you're dinner.  They're obviously not in the mood for
playing around.  It's a good think Ennia carries a good number of 
poison remedies.</LongDescription>
