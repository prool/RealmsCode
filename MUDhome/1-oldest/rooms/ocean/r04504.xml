  <ShortDescription>You are in a small supply room where you may purchase limited supplies.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look around, you realize this place is exactly what the name says.
There are bibles, hymnals, prayer shawls, strings of beads, icons and
and a variety of cassocks and albs on hangers.  A small silver keg appears
to hold ceremonial wine, and there are a lot of small silver cups nearby.
Looks like the acolytes have been drinking the wine.  Ask the acolyte for
a selection.  (type:  selection acolyte)</LongDescription>
