  <ShortDescription>You are on a steep mountain road leading down from Castle Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Actually, you might be on a steep mountain road leading up to Castle Rutger.
It's hard to say whether a road is leading up or down, so perhaps one should
just say it runs between Castle Rutger and the mountain ridge below.  This
road certainly changes direction often.</LongDescription>
