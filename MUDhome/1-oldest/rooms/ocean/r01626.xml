  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, between the Allisk Manor and the Cattle Ranch.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large cattle ranch to the south provides much of the meat required
by a city the size of Oceancrest.  The cattle are raised on the ranch to
the south and then brought over to the Slaughterhouse across the street
to be humanely destroyed and then packaged for consumption.  The farmers
are always in need of a few more cattle slaughterers at the Slaughterhouse
off of Appleton Road, but do not approve of killing their cattle on the
ranch.</LongDescription>
