  <ShortDescription>You are in the main downstairs public room of Hans Granovetter's Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rough tables and chairs are around the room with most of them near the fire 
place.  There is a large kitchen in the back, and the smell of good food
is in the air.  Hanging on the walls are trophy size heads of animals, but
most of them are animals you have never seen before.</LongDescription>
