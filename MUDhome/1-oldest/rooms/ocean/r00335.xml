  <ShortDescription>You are on Uland Way, just west of the intersection with Rum Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A number of small shops line the twisting street, catering mostly to the
people who live here on the island.  Immediately to the north is a dirty
llittle fish market, which gives the street a pleasant smell.  Shopkeepers
lounge in their doorways and eye you as you stroll along.  Uland Way seems
to twist out of sight to the west.</LongDescription>
