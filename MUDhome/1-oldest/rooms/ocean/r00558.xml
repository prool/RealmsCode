  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, south of the Open Air Fish Market.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Leviathan Fishery provides a number of freshly caught fish and other
seafood in their open air market to the public on a daily basis.  The
demand for fish is not real strong as there is only one major fish seller
in town.  However, a fresh fish now and then is an excellent change from
beef and venison, especially during the colder months when meat is scarce.</LongDescription>
