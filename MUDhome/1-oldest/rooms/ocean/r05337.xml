  <ShortDescription>Hot sand blows across the highway here, almost obscuring your view of it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The K'tral Desert on the south side of the road seems to have a definite
demarcation point, abruptly ending at the edge of the road.  On the north
side there is green grass and trees.  This seems to be the only place that
sand has invaded the northern side of the highway.</LongDescription>
