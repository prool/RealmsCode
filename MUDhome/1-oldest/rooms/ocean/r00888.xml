  <Name>Grape Picker's Shacks</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the center of a group of shacks in the Chateau Richland Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The shacks are well cared for, but they are still just shacks.  A small
pond of water lies to the west and you can see a number of very ugly
children playing there.  A large barn is to the north, and you can see
a few people working in there.  The grape vines cover a vast area behind
the barn and past the pond.</LongDescription>
