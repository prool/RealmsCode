  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillborough Way, just west of the Necropolis Avenue crossing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On both sides of the street, you can see a large shopping complex with all
sorts of armors, weapons, gems and jewelry for sale.  There's even a
small pub in the northern complex, which looks kind of rowdy.  To the
east, you can see the intersection with Necropolis Avenue.</LongDescription>
