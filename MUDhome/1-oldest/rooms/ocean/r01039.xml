  <LongDescription>The Dragon Tooth Inn is located to the east of Oceanview Drive.  This
is one of the more luxurious Inns in Oceancrest, and is heavily guarded
at all times, for the protection of the guests.  Although crime isn't 
a major concern in this part of town, the presense of security guards 
makes the customer's stays more relaxing.  Royalty also stays here.</LongDescription>
