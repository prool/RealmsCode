  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, just north of the Southwest Observational Post.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are near the southwestern corner of the city, which is marked by
the Southwest Observational Station, located south of Golden Dolphin
Way.  On the east, you can see a small store with a plaque which 
reads "Dryfus' Elephant Leather Works."  Elephant leather is one of the
strongest forms of leather available, but also very heavy.  It tends
to be more comfortable for thieves and assassins than metallic armors.
Although mages may use elephant leather, it tends to be very heavy and
uncomfortable for these people.</LongDescription>
