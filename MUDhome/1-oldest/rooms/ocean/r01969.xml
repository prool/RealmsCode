  <ShortDescription>You have entered a quasi-dimensional gap between reality and non-reality.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Kaldeas built this room to house the undead creatures he consulted.   
Not only does this seem like some purgatory for undead creatures,
it also appears to be some sort of dimensional door into another world.
Unfortunately, you can't really see enough to make any sense out of any
of this.  However, the large number of undead creatures in the room
makes you believe that perhaps you will be joining their ranks soon.</LongDescription>
