  <ShortDescription>You are walking through the dark, underground caverns beneath the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south, you can see the other side of the cliff which overlooks
the Dennanl Abyss.  The rope bridge which would normally allow you
to cross the abyss in relative safety appears to be cut, and hangs
limply on the other side of the cavern.  The cliff you are on appears
to be lower than the cliff on the other side, suggesting the caverns
head deeper into the ground.</LongDescription>
