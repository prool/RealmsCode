  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Main Street, just south of the Adrilite Museum.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side of the road you see a shop filled with snakes and spiders.
The sign above the door says, "Ennia's Venemous Pets."  There is a very ugly
spider painted on the window.  She really doen't get much business.  On the
north side of the road is the Adrilite Museum of Natural History, a place
of civic pride for citizens of Oceancrest.  The entrance is on Marina Way.</LongDescription>
