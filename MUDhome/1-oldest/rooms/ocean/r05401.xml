  <ShortDescription>This is a beautiful and pleasant country lane, known as Forest Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road has gotten a little wider, and with the trees further off there
seems to be more light from overhead.  Wildflowers grow along the wayside,
and birds can be heard in the distance.  Occasionally, there's a sound
you cannot identify.  oh, well.</LongDescription>
