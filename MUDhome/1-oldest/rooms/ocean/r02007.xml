  <ShortDescription>You are on the eastern side of Lake View Road, just north of Myrr Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lake View Road proceeds around the city's granary and dairy storage
areas bringing you towards Lake Kista.  The shimmering blue water of
the lake is breathtaking, even though the lake itself isn't much 
bigger than the city.  To the west you can see the dairy cows and 
production area.  There is a small field of grass where the cows are
sleeping under thick and bountiful fruit trees.</LongDescription>
