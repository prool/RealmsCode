  <ShortDescription>You are in a well lit tunnel intersection in the goblin underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Strangely, you notice the light is not coming from any torches, but instead
there is a glow being emitted from panels in the ceiling.  To the north, an
archway leads to what may be the goblin's altar.  There are several bronze
statues of various goblins surrounding the archway.  One particularly large
and vicious looking chiseled statue has the name "Bythme" inscribed at the
base.  As you stand here, you hear a gratingly harsh sound of chanting and
you smell burning flesh coming from that archway.  Now you remember 
stories you heard in the pubs, of goblin blood sacrifices.  The passage
leads off into darkness in all directions.</LongDescription>
