  <ShortDescription>You are on the Karlberg Bridge running across the river Othax.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The River Othax is not a very hospitible one, and tends to be the cause
of many deaths of children who enjoy playing in the rapid waters.  The
Karlberg Bridge runs across the river along Leviathan Drive.  The bridge
is very sturdy, but it still is a long way down.</LongDescription>
