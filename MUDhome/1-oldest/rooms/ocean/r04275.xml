  <ShortDescription>You are on the second level of the Stairway of the Nobles in Castle Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A dreary and narrow hallway leads to several little offices along here.
These are the administrative offices of the castle, where clerks maintain
files and records.  Nothing ever gets lost here, and the archives are filled
to overflowing, but the clerks know where every piece of paper is located.</LongDescription>
