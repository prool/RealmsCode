  <Name>Antechamber of the Imperial Crystal Tower</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the antechamber of an astoundingly brilliant diamond tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the tower seems to be two massive doors which seem totally
immovable by any natural force.  There are crystalline warriors standing at
sentry posts, while others seem to be patrolling the area.  They apparently
provide a very tight security to the only visible entry of the entire tower.</LongDescription>
