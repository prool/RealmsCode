  <ShortDescription>You are in the Keslar Family Mausoleum.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Mausoleum is well furnished with the great art and works of deceased
members of the family.  Each is given a small crypt where their ashes
are placed for all eternity.  This place does not seem all that 'scary'.
In fact, the place looks well visited.  </LongDescription>
