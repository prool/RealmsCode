  <ShortDescription>You are in a long east-west tunnel under the Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This tunnel seems to be mostly inhabitated by rats, spiders and bats,
but occasionally you sense something bigger moving in the darkness.  It
doesn't seem to get any closer to you, but you can feel the presense as
you continue your way through the damp and slippery tunnel.</LongDescription>
