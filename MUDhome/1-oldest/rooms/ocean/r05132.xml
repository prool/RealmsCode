  <Name>Broken East Wall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the eastern wall of the castle, but a section is broken.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small wooden door, the only one you have seen that wasn't burned, is on 
the inside wall.  The door is either locked or wedged, but it's impossible
to open.  there might be a place to climb in, however, considering the
broken area of the inside wall.</LongDescription>
