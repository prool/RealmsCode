  <ShortDescription>You are in the southern end of the gypsy shit pit.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Between the biting flys and the terrible stink, you are getting sick
to your stomach.  The fumes down here are deadly, and you cannot last
much longer.  Somewhere at this end of the pit is an exit, but you had
better hurry and find it before you are overcome by the smell.</LongDescription>
