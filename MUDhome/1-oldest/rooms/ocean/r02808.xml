  <ShortDescription>You are walking through the dark and desolate hallway under the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The long, dark hallway continues to the north and south seemingly without
end.  The silent air gives you an eerie feeling that somehow you are
being watched, but you can't see anything in either direction that might
be a threat.</LongDescription>
