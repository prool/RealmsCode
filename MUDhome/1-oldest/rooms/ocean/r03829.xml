  <ShortDescription>You are in the middle of the Grandstand viewing the main attractions.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are bewildered by all the goings on here.  You have a view of three
rings, and a show in each ring.  High above the rings there are three
platforms, and a trapeze and highwire.  The Ringmaster is announcing the
shows in the center ring, while dancing elephants plod around him.  In the
ring on the right, clowns make you laugh, and acrobats do fast flips and
somersaults.  On the left, tiger tamers coax tigers to jump through hoops
and stand on two legs.  In the air high above the ground, trapeze artists
gracefully fly from their perches onto the trapeze, literally holding on
with sheer will.  Next to them, a tightrope walker delicately crosses from
one platform to another.  Someone shouts, "Down in front!"</LongDescription>
