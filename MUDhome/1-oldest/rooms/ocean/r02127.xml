  <ShortDescription>You are at the southernmost end of the infamous Hall of Doom.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway continues here with even more exhibits.  There are rooms
to the east, west and south with varying monsters from various exotic
locations from around the world.  To the west, there is a sign above
the arch that says "Dragons and Brimstone".  To the south, there 
appears to be some sort of desert environment, though you can't really
make much out and there are no descriptions.  To the east, there is 
a sign saying "Terrors from the Underground".  The hallway leads back
towards the main foyer to the north.</LongDescription>
