  <Name>Kuroth's Tunnel</Name>
  <LongDescription>You are in a dark and evil smelling tunnel under the Hanging Gardens.
There are bats and other creatures here, and its not a good place to be.
Water trickles down the center of the muddy floor making the way rather
slippery.  Be careful not to fall into some sort of trap.  The light you 
see to the west is the tunnel entrance in the hedge maze.</LongDescription>
