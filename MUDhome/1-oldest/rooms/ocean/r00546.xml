  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Lelion Way and Amberton Lane.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the northeast corner of the intersection, you can see a number of 
small temples and shrines dedicated to the lesser appreciated dieties of
lesser appreciated races such as the drow, goblins and kobalds.  Although
they are authentic, people usually visit these temples mostly out of 
curiosity rather than to pray.</LongDescription>
