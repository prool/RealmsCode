  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Kafkan Way, north of the South Oceancrest Post Office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small postal facility lies on the south side of the road.  Being that
communications are the most important thing in a good society, the mail
system tends to be very accurate and prompt.  On the north side of the
road is a small fountain.  The fountain seems to be sitting in the 
middle of the large park on the Iilandi Campus.</LongDescription>
