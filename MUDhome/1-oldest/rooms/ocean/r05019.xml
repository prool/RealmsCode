  <ShortDescription>You have reached the northern gorge near Mount Aphinix.  70.n4.e0.s0.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The northern cliffs are much too high for your steed to fly over, so you
will have to avoid them.  You can fly higher, however, if you want a better
look at the sheer rock face coming down from the mountain.  To the east
it looks like the southern face of Mount Aphinix has a more steep slope
to it.  A long way to the west, there is a jutting shoulder of the high
cliffs, and you will probably have to turn south.</LongDescription>
