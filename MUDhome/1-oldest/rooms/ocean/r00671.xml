  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hofton Avenue, running parallel to the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking to the north, you can see the massive City Walls, which protect
the City of Oceancrest from any attacks or sieges by any faction outside
of Oceancrest.  Although there hasn't been an uprising in a long time,
the city knows that when their guard is let down, some rebel force will
begin an attack.</LongDescription>
