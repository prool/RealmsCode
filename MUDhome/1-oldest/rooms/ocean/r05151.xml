  <ShortDescription>This is a barren and godforsaken hallway, not even a mouse is here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Grime, dirt and ashes cover everything with a fine, black powder.
The hallway is as quiet as a tomb, and your own footfall is muffled in
the soft soot on the floor.</LongDescription>
