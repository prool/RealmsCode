  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east, you can see a gray building called "Kaldeas' Mansion of
Illusion".  The building is not very tall and seems mysteriously narrow.
It's not a very good engineering job on the part of the architech.  There 
doesn't appear to be a door on this side of the building.  Over to the west
you can see a large building that appears to span the entire city block.
There is a large gem hovering about the building, radiating a purple glow
as the sunlight hits it.</LongDescription>
