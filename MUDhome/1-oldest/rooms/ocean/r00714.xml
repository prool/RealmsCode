  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillborough Way, between David's Books and Leo's Waxworks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>David's Used Book Store is known for having strange and mysterious tomes
that no one can seem to understand.  Most of the mages see his stuff as
junk, but there might be a few surprises.  On the south side of the road
is Leo's Waxworks, where wax is formed, melted and created into candles
and other useful items.</LongDescription>
