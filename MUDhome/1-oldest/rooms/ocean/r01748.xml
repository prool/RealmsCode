  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Wakeforest Drive, east of the Obidian Housing Complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive Obidian Complex is only dwarved by the high City Walls on the
opposite side of the road.  Although the Complex is much higher than the
City Walls, there has not been a recorded case where someone has actually
tried to jump over the walls from this direction.  Being so close to the
City Walls can sometimes be a problem as the large buildings are the first
to be hit.  This poor planning, however, has not resulted in any casualties.</LongDescription>
