  <LongDescription>Since Eidenhoft Boulevard runs northeast from the intersection to the 
west, a small wedge is created between the two roads, which has been
carefully decorated with trees and shrubs.  To the south of Waterfront
Way, there is a large building with three shops.  Directly to the south
is a door with a sign which reads "Treasure Cove Exotic Supplies" in
sparkling green letters. </LongDescription>
