  <ShortDescription>You are in the most beautiful and serene part of the Garden.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Great slabs of flat rock hang over a reflecting pool, while fruit trees are
heavy with their perfect produce.  Someone has lodged a keg of mild brandy
into the bole of a walnut tree, and it seems to never empty.  There are 
bright, sparkling points of light in the air.  A bridge goes to the north.</LongDescription>
