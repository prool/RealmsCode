  <ShortDescription>You are on the great Lyanden Road, which runs from Oceancrest to the eastern
cities in the Land of Mordor.  South is a toll booth.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north you see the road runs through a valley in rolling hills.  Over
to the east, the hills get steeper, eventually rising to meet Mount Aphinix,
home of the mountain trolls.  Looking southeast, the grand Lyanden Road
disappears around a curve heading towards the Vallenda Pass which skirts
the Southern Nartiz Range.</LongDescription>
