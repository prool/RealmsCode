  <ShortDescription>You are on Garden Circle Road, between thick hedges on either side.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The base of the many-tiered Hanging Gardens is made of solid gold, with
an occasional gemstone set in for contrast.  There are also places where
you see runes and cryptograms cut into the gold.  There's probably a message
here, if you could understand it.</LongDescription>
