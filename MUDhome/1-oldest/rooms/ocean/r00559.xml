  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Oceancrest Avenue, north of the Adrilite Museum.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Adrilite Museum of Natural History gives the citizens of 
Oceancrest a glimpse into the world outside of the City Walls, without
actually having to leave the safety of the city.  The museum houses many
exotic species, rarely seen in Oceancrest, including a few very dangerous
and deadly ones.  On the north side of the street there is a shop almost
hidden from view.  A faded sign says World of Magical Wonders.</LongDescription>
