  <LongDescription>Tragirsha was not always a toad, having been born of humans who made their
home on the Nyyron trail.  Her mother was a herbilist who could cure the 
blind, but when an evil demon from one of the watch towers sought her help,
she permanently blinded him.  To her sorrow, he was able to turn her only
daughter into a giant toad.  Tragirsha lives here alone, in the cellar.</LongDescription>
