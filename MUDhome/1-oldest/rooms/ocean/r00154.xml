  <ShortDescription>You are on Taragon Road, near a broken section of the village wall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mayor's office keeps promising to send a construction crew to repair the
wall, but it has ben seventeen years since a copper dragon crashed into the
wall, destroying a section of it and killing the dragon's rider.  Through
the break in the wall, you can see sheep in a green pasture, and a heavily
wooded area further to the east.  On the west side of the road is a fortune
teller's small shack.</LongDescription>
