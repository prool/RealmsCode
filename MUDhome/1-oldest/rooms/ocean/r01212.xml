  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, north of the Corn Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The DeNail Corn Fields are located to the south of here.  Farmer DeNail
is always willing to hire on any unskilled laborers to pick corn and
scare away crows and other pests.  The entrance to the Corn Fields is 
located off of Lankshire Parkway to the east.  On the north side of the
road, you can see the Oceancrest Grannary building, which is currently
under construction.  The current grannary has exceeded its capacity,
thus a new one is being built to supplement it.</LongDescription>
