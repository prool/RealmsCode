  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on a wide highway known as Lyanden Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees are thick on the north side of the road, but strangely none
are growing on the south side.  The road is a true demarcation for two
really different environments.  There is nothing but rocks and sand to 
the south. Far to the northeast you can see snow covered mountains.</LongDescription>
