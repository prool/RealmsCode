  <Name>Forest Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are traveling around a forest trail, trapped by some force shield.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you continue around the circle, you notice a strange, reddish haze
all around you.  It appears to be some sort of dense red fog, although
you are unsure where exactly it leads.  The path you are on continues
to the south and southwest.  When you look at the trees, they almost 
appear to be making faces at you.  This forest is very strange.</LongDescription>
