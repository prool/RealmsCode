  <Name>North Gate for Brownhaven</Name>
  <LongDescription>You are outside the north gate of the village of Brownhaven.
There is a dusty caravan trail stretching in the distance.  It leads both
east and west, and disappears out of sight in both directions.  A sign post
indicates that Oceancrest is west, while Kista is east.  A broken pointer
hangs on the post, so you have no idea which way to go for the elven city
of Hafnia.  You do know it's located somewhere in the northern mountains.</LongDescription>
