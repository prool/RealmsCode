  <ShortDescription>You are on Hafnia circle road, which encircles the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This road goes clear around the city.  Immediately to the west is
Jacob's Repair Shoppe, where you may have an elven smith work on your
weapons and armor.  There is a field behind the shoppe, but you cannot
enter it from here.  It seems to be some kind of training grounds.  A lot
of people are coming and going further north.</LongDescription>
