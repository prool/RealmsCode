  <ShortDescription>You are cautiously walking across the Anthian Bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Anthian Bridge crosses over the River Othax, flowing rapidly beneath
your feet.  The bridge does not look very sturdy, but luckily, it's
not too far across the river.  The river banks form quite an impressive
cliff along Yellow Marsh Road and Neilian Drive, to the north and south
respectively.</LongDescription>
