  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Phexton Road and East Ulandia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can go east or north, but you are in a corner of the village, and 
cannot go in any other direction.  There is a speciality armor shop on
the corner, catering only to large sized people.  Seems like blatent
discrimination, but who's going to complain?  The owner is a retired
fighter who rose to a very high level in the ranks of fighters.</LongDescription>
