  <ShortDescription>You are in a small gift shop at the entrance to the Milsene Museum.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Museum Gift Shop carries all sorts of trinkets and supplies that
are replicas of those you might have seen in the Museum.  Since much of
the Museum is based on magic, a number of magical potions may also be
obtained here as well.  The door to the west leads out onto Tower Lane. 
The exit to the east leads into the Museum itself.</LongDescription>
