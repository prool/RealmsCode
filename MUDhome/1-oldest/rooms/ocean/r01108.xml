  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, just north of the Golden Dolphin Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the city of Oceancrest is located south of Main Street,
which is just south of here.  Being so close to the entrance, the Golden
Dolphin does pretty good business as an inn.  Stables for customers 
traveling on horseback are provided a block to the east of the Inn.
On the north side of the road, there is Michael's Repair Shop, where
just about anything may be fixed up for a price.</LongDescription>
