  <LongDescription>You are on Alturis Road, between the Cathedral and the Hanging Gardens.
The Cathedral is run by an order of monks who believe they must forever
cover their eyes to simulate blindness, and thus approach the attainment
of knowledge without being corrupted by worldly attractions.  They once
had many gods who resided in the Cathedral whom they believe taught them
this strange behaviour, but now there is only the Oracle remaining.</LongDescription>
