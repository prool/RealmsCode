  <ShortDescription>You are in a cold, damp tunnel which seems to go on forever.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel appears to turn sharply, and doesn't seem to follow a straight
path for more than a few meters.  Occasionally you have to climb either up
or down to continue through these broken tunnels.  This is very confusing.</LongDescription>
