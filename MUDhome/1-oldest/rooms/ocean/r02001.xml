  <ShortDescription>You are at the North Gate for the city of Kista.  Kista Avenue is south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Outside the city gates is a very long road which connects to the great
city of Oceancrest to the west.  As you stand here just inside the huge
gate, you notice there are stables to the east where you may leave your
horses, or whatever you may be riding.  Further to the south is the center 
of town, where you may find more information about this famous city.</LongDescription>
