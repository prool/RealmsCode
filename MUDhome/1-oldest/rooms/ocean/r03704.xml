  <ShortDescription>You are in the high crow's nest of the dreaded pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From here you can see the entire Nylandian Bay and Lithium Inlet which 
feeds fresh water to the bay.  A great deal of the city can be seen, and
there are some wonderous sights indeed.  The famous Lyanden Castle can
be seen in the distance.  You have heard that the castle is where the 
council of mages meets, and that Princess Runella represents the city
of Oceancrest on that council.</LongDescription>
