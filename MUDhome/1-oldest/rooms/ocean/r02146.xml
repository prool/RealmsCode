  <Name>Path by the Rockface</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a path between great boulders and rocks, near a rockface.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The rockface rises at a steep angle, but looks safe to climb if you have
the proper equipment.  It's hard to tell what might be up there, as there
is a rock shelf a few meters up.  It looks like the fissures up there are
big enough to enter, and they might prove interesting to explore.</LongDescription>
