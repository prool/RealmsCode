  <LongDescription>The glacier pass comes to an end at the cliffs overlooking the Abyss to
the north and continues through the glacier to the west.  A cold breeze
comes up from the Abyss almost on a regular basis.  Looking down into the
Abyss, you can see nothing.  The Abyss appears to continue forever in all
directions.  You must fly to go north.</LongDescription>
