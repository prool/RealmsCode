  <Name>Melbourne Avenue/Nagaritha Drive Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Melbourne Avenue and Nagaritha Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This rather busy intersection is more or less the center of activity for 
the southeastern section of town.  On the northwest corner of the inter-
section is the Melbourne Entertainment Arena, where criminals and other 
degenerates are placed to be stoned, mutilated and killed.  Surrounding
the Arena are a number of small shops and stores where just about anything
may be purchased.</LongDescription>
