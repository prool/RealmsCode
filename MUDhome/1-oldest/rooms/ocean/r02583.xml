  <ShortDescription>This area of the Garden is noted for the quality of fruit it produces.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Every variety of fruit tree that exists seems to be here, and each has
been carefully tended so that it produces only the very best fruit.  A 
pair of trees near the path are drooping with beautiful ripe pears.  The
second level of the Garden is up a winding path to the southwest.</LongDescription>
