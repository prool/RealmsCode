  <ShortDescription>You are on Marina Way, east of the Nylandian Bay Shipmaster's Office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Shipmaster is in charge of all ships entering and leaving the harbor.
This is a thankless job as everyone is always in a hurry to either enter
and quickly get rid of their cargo, or to get out of the harbor.  On the 
east side of the road is the Temple of Ahto, the Finnish God of the
Oceans and Seas.  Ahead to the north is Marina Circle.</LongDescription>
