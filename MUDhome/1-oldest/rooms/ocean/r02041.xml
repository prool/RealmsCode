  <ShortDescription>You are on the southernmost side of the famous Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a trail to the south leading out of Kista into the dense woods.
Kista was founded by the Triad of Wisdom after the fall of Randolf, the
creater of the Hanging Gardens.  The Triad represent the three dominant
races whom the elves had contact with: the humans and the dwarves. 
Although the elves were not comfortable with dwarves, they persuaded them
to be a part of the Triad to promote peace in the land.  The Gardens were
maintained in honor of the coming together.</LongDescription>
