  <ShortDescription>This is a wide lane through the Enchanted Forest.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Heavy brush is on either side, and has apparently been cut back recently.
You can see fresh wagon marks and steaming piles of horse manure in the
middle of the lane, all evidence that this is a well traveled path in the
woods.  A cross lane is over to the west.  The path disappears around a bend
going in the southeast direction.</LongDescription>
