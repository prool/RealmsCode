  <ShortDescription>This room vibrates and shudders, as if the walls themselves are in pain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Something tells you that the force of life, which binds all living things
together, has been horribly twisted and mutilated here by some unthinkable
magic.  There is another room to the west, from which you can see a
fireworks-like abundance of light, and hear constant booming and screaming
noises.  To the south, a passage leads back into the more normal regions
of the underground city.</LongDescription>
