  <ShortDescription>You are at the middle of a winding set of steps leading deeper into the
bowels of the castle.  Not all parts of the castle have been explored,
and whenever someone makes a map of the known rooms and archives it in
the library, it always seems to strangely disappear.  Set in the north
wall are a set of shackles and a heavy chain hangs from the ceiling.</ShortDescription>
