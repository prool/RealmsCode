  <ShortDescription>A deep valley is on the north side of the road. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side there is a pleasant mountain pasture, where you see a
shepherd and his flock of sheep.  Looks like a small stone building is in
the pasture, perhaps to provide shelter from the frequent mountain storms.
The road drops swiftly to the southwest.  Hafnia Mountain towers over you.</LongDescription>
