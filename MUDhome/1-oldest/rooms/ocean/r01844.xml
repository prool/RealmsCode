  <Name>Western Shore of the Ramdes Bridge</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the western shore of the Ramdes River, just west of the bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The narrow bridge crosses over the relatively calm, but very deep Ramdes 
River, which eventually empties into Lyanden Lake.  The river runs from
the northern mountains through Oceancrest, and eventually ends up in the
ocean.  The eastern half of the Barbarian Pits are pretty much deserted
and reserved for very powerful barbarians who would rather be left alone.</LongDescription>
