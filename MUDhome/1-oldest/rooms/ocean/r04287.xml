  <ShortDescription>You are at the top of Rutger's private stairway in the Tower Castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several doors are open which apparently lead to the family quarters of
the Prince.  There is also a metal door with a bar across it, and another
door from which you hear the sounds of guards.  Could this be the castle's
fabled vault?  Rutger is reported to have fabulous wealth.</LongDescription>
