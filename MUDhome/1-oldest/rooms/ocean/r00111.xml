  <ShortDescription>You are near the southwest corner of the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are also just south of a string of expensive little shops, where you
can buy most anything if you have the gold.  Directly north of you is a
jewelry shop.  Next door is a shop which is known to specialize in footwear
for all races.  The shop belongs to a very old hobbitish shoemaker.</LongDescription>
