  <ShortDescription>You are on the servant's stairwell, below the ground floor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can either go up or out the door, but there is nothing else here of
interest.  The walls are heavy gray stone, and cold and clammy to the touch.
The door does not look as though it has been opened in a long time.</LongDescription>
