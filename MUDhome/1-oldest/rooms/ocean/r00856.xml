  <ShortDescription>You are in a strange hallway that glows in a sickly green.  A light mist
makes it impossible to see where you're going.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you stumble around in the mist, you begin bumping into walls and
realize that you're still in the same corridor and it does not appear
to curve or bend.  It would help if you had a compass that worked
because yours keeps going around in circles.</LongDescription>
