  <ShortDescription>You are south of Hafnia Boulevard, in a north-south alley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You would not have normally seen this alley here if you were not looking
so carefully.  You have been following a number of footprints and they
all seem to lead to this one door.  Unfortunately, the door is locked.
Do you have the right key or do you think you can pick it?</LongDescription>
