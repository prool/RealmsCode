  <Name>Forest Road/Redwood Tree</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The woods are getting thicker along here.  A redwood blocks the main road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This redwood towers over the other trees nearby and looks like it is much
older than the rest of the forest.  The road splits and circles around it.
Looks like there is a path going from east to west.</LongDescription>
