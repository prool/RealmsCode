  <ShortDescription>You are in front of the Embassy Court entry foyer into the complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Embassy Court houses the embassies of the elven and dwarven
delegations.  Both delegations are rather small, primarily because the
number of elves and dwarves in Oceancrest is also relatively small.
The delegation serve as the collective body of all the elves or dwarves
in Oceancrest for political and social purposes.</LongDescription>
