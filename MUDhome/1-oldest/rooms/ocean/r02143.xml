  <ShortDescription>You are in a part of the forest where large birds make their homes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A path leads through the hedge going north, and another path continues
to the south.  There are a number of large birdhouses hanging from the
trees all about you.  A group of crows, larger than any you have ever
seen before, are talking above your head.  Strangely, you understand
every word they say.  You might be able to join in their conversation.</LongDescription>
