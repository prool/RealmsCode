  <ShortDescription>You can see the impressive City Walls on the north side of Hofton Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The imposing City Walls provide much of the security for the town.
Being on the coast of the Respitial Sea, it is has been easy to attack and
overpower the city.  Of course, this has happened many times, so in order
to prevent something like this happening again, the City Walls were built
around the town on the land and even into the ocean for the ultimate in
city defense.</LongDescription>
