  <ShortDescription>You have entered the shop of a retired old drunk, Finesse the thief.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although retired from the adventuring business, Finesse still likes to stay
in touch with his old friends.  Many of them drop in here to laugh and share
a drink, and tell lies about their exploits.  Occasionally, Shadowhawk and
Sisyphus are here, and Finesse's cousin Fin even stops by sometimes.</LongDescription>
