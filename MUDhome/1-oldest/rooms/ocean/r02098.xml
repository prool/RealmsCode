  <ShortDescription>You are in the Western Tower, home to Elise, the youngest mage in Mordor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Elise is one of the most powerful mages perhaps in the world.  It is quite
puzzling that such a young woman is already a White Moon and a Preserver
Wizard, the highest rank that can be achieved.  The Order of the White Moon
is an elven sorority of lawful, good wizards whose ranks are limited only to
those who have proven their skill and devotion to goodness.  Any wizard may
petition to enter, as the sorority is not limited to elves nor females.  The
Order of the White Moon is a powerful ally of the Red-Robed wizards in the
City of Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
