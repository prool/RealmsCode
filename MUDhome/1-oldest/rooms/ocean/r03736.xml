  <ShortDescription>You are on the west side of the Dragon Tooth Inn in the public room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is a nice, quiet little bar devoted to serious drinking.  As long as
you are not loud, you can get as drunk as you please in here.  There are
a number of officers from the city guard in here, each sitting alone and
drinking at a steady rate.  Must be something about the job, eh?  The new
owner of the Dragon Tooth Inn, a half-giant named Tharonwold, spends his
time here serving drinks.  He's been known to take one or two himself.</LongDescription>
