  <ShortDescription>You are standing in a shallow pool of mud.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Before you, you see a vast underground pool which has been muddied by the
soft dirt walls which contain it.  The murky, dark waters make it impossible
to see what may lie within the pool itself.  However, several small ripples
which move toward your direction indicate that something may be approaching,
completely submerged and masked from your sight.</LongDescription>
