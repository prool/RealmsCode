  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Highland Avenue and Kafkan Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The City Walls make a turn towards the north and the west, running parallel
to both Highland Avenue and Kafkan Way.  A lone Guard Tower stands on the
southeastern corner of the intersection, watching over and protecting the
town from various invaders from the mountains and plains.  It has been
a long time since the city was last attacked, but as soon as the guard
slacks, invaders will probably attack again.</LongDescription>
