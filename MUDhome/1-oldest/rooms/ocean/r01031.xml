  <LongDescription>Darby Reynold's famous shipyard is located east of Oceanview Drive.  This
location has been the center of the ship-building industry ever since 
ships were introduced to Oceancrest.  To the west is the South Nylandian
Bay Guard Station, where marines and other city guards constantly patrol
the open seas for pirates and other hooligans unworthy of freedom.</LongDescription>
