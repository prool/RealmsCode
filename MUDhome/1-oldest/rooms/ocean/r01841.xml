  <Name>The Southern Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the southern border of the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a warm, bubbling pool of mud located to the northwest of the
path where a number of barbarians are resting.  It appears to be some
sort of hot water spring bubbling through the mud that gives off the
heat.  The path curves to the northeast where it meets the Center Path.
The path to the west runs towards the Shaman's hut.</LongDescription>
