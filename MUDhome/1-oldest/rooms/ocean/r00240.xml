  <Name>Central Sewer Channels</Name>
  <ShortDescription>It is here that the two largest streams of sewer water cross.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One stream of water runs northwest to southeast, and another runs from
northeast to southwest.  It's not so deep that you can't walk in it,
so all four exits are a distinct travelling possibility for you.  Above
you is the sewer grate through with many adventurers (as well as sewer
workers and other nasties) enter the sewage canals.</LongDescription>
