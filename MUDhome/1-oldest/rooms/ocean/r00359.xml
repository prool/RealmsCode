  <ShortDescription>You are in a nasty smelling alley near the southern end of Rum Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large cats circle away from you, staying out of your reach, but
never turning their backs on you either.  The stench makes you want to
hold your nose.  Why on earth did you come in here, anyway?  A doorway
is slightly open in the old building, and a sign says "Welfare." 
The alley is littered with garbage and broken kegs and boxes.</LongDescription>
