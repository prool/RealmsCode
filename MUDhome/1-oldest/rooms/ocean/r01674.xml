  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, taking in some of the scenery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is not much on this side of the town.  On the south side of the
road, you can see a number of small houses where the farmers and their
families live.  The proximity of the farm lands and fields in the southern
part of town makes their lives much simpler.  The intersection with 
Overland Drive lies to the west.</LongDescription>
