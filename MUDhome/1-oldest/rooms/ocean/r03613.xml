  <ShortDescription>You are on the Ladies Walk, near the eastern end of the wide tunnel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ladies Walk continues to the west from here.  A hallway runs north
and south, giving you a choice of directions.  The hallway is lighted
with heavy candles high on the wall every few meters, but appears
to fade away in the distance at either end.  Oaken doors are closed
along the hallway, but a few have light coming from under them.</LongDescription>
