  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the northern edge of Allisk Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Allisk Circle is named after the Countess Natasha de Allisk, or more
formally, the Allisk Mansion, which is located to the east of Lankshire 
Parkway, just south of the Necropolis.  A corner of the estate is visible
from here.  You can see it on the northeast corner, surrouned by wall
of metal bars.  The Allisk Circle is about as close as anyone dares to
get to the Allisk Manor, but it can be entered from Overland Drive.</LongDescription>
