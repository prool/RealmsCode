  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, south of the Panther Headquarters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Panther Guards are a small sub-division of the regular city guards
that patrol the southeastern section of town.  Since much of this area is
residential, they are more capable of handling simple disputes in the
housing complex or stopping small bar fights in any of the many local
bars.  On the south side of the road, you can see the impressive Allakaren
Pyramid as it stands towering above the city.</LongDescription>
