  <ShortDescription>You are in a spectacular hall of glimmering orange jaciniths lining the
walls, continuing to the west.  To the east is the giant iron gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>An apparition appears before you in the form of a beautiful maiden in
glimmering white.  She wears a robe and amulet with a mysterious symbol
shaped like a large, upside-down Y.  She says to you: "Your quest begins
here.  Before you can enter the East Gate, you must find a key that 
is more magnificantly yellow than gold.  The Crystal Alcove is filled 
with illusions.  Trust your senses and you cannot fail.  Do not enter
the Alcove until you have found an object which light cannot penetrate."  
She disappears into a puff of smoke before you can ask any more questions,
such as, what is this quest she talks about.  </LongDescription>
