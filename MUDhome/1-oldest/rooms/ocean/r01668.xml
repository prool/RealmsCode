  <ShortDescription>You are on Appleton Road, between Overland Drive and Waterfront Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One of the reasons there aren't more diagonally running roads in Oceancrest
is because of the useless land they create.  There is a small, triangular
sliver of land between Appleton, Waterfront and Overland, which is more
or less undevelopable.  A couple of small monuments have been put up in
dedicated to the farmers, but nothing else really can fit there.</LongDescription>
