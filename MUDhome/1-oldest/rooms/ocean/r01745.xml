  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Wakeforest Drive, west of the omnimous City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large City Walls dwarf the largest half-giant in sheer size, making it
nearly impossible to scale from either side.  This is useful in that it 
prevents outside invaders from infiltrating the city and also prevents
criminals from escaping.  On the west side of the road is the Shrine of
Moradin, the dwarven God of Creation.  The Oceancrest Orphanage is north.</LongDescription>
