  <Name>Forest Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a forest trail with a red haze drifting overhead.  The grass     
is greener than the Enchanted Forest and the trees are florishing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A voice speaks out to you:  "You have chosen the path of danger, as would  
any worthy adventurer.  Careful, as you will find the Adamantine Dragon's
cave to the west.  A smart adventurer does not fight when he or she
does not have to."  The voice ends on a single musical note.   The trail
seems to travel in a full circle.  You can walk to the northeast and
southeast from here.  The dense forest and a mysterious force shield
prevent you from leaving the path's circle.</LongDescription>
