  <ShortDescription>This is Galgorn Way, named after a hero who saved the village years ago.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Long ago, the Mountain Trolls had an alliance with the red dragons and tried
to conquer the village of Phexton.  Galgorn, although not a Mountain Giant,
helped the people of the village and defeated two of the red dragons.  
When the trolls saw that, they retreated and have not been back since.
Several homes are on the north side of the way, and the village green is
to the south.  There appears to be a statue in the center of the green.</LongDescription>
