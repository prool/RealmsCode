  <Name>Entrance to the Barbarian Pits</Name>
  <ShortDescription>Welcome to the Barbarian Pits, just north of the City of Oceancrest. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Society, deeming the barbarians as just too barbaric, has set aside this
small park to the east of the Northern Highway as a place reserved only 
for their use.  Here, the barbarian culture is nurtured and passed down
through the generations instead of simply being forgotten, as was done
in the past before they moved here.  Not particularly happy with their
small park, the barbarians are still content enough to stay here and not
overrun the city to the south.</LongDescription>
