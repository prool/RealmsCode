  <Name>Path To The Manor</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the brick path that leads straight up to the front door.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Manor looks much bigger than it did from the road.  The creaky wood
that has deteriorated over the many years looks like it might fall apart
if you sneeze in just the right direction.  There is a door directly to
the west of you that obviously leads into the creepy manor itself.  You
have to keep saying to yourself, it's just an old house, nothing more...</LongDescription>
