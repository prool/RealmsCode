  <ShortDescription>Goldenrod Avenue continues east and west through the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are walking along a narrow road between the village wall and the open
back doors of several shops.  The shop entrances are actually on another 
alley to the south.  Looks like a lot of garbage gets thrown out along
this alley, judging from the stink and the piles of fresh refuse.  Alley
cats and dirty little kids fight each other for anything edible.</LongDescription>
