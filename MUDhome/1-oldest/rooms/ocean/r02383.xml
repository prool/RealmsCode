  <ShortDescription>You are in a deep cavern, heading further into the depths of the land.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a strange door in the middle of the hallway, facing the north,
which appears to lead into a larger room.  The cavern descends further
into the depths of the planet towards the east.  The floor slopes 
steeply down the corridor and is covered with slime, making it tough
to walk around on without slipping.</LongDescription>
