  <Name>Swamp Entrance</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The main path seems to go through a swamp to the north, and south into a
short and narrow valley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The swamp water is still and dark, with both living and dead trees standing
in it.  Moss seems to hang from almost everything, and bubbles slowly form
in the mud and burst, emitting a foul stench.  The gas from the mud may
even be slightly toxic.  Strange there doesn't seem to be birds in this
part of the forest.</LongDescription>
