  <ShortDescription>You are on the main path through a quaint and charming little village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There seems to be a village square in the middle of a small clearing.
A great many elven folk are busy doing their daily chores, and most simply
ignore you as they go about their business.  A sign post points west, but 
you cannot read the language.  The houses seem to be built into living
trees in the oak forest around you.</LongDescription>
