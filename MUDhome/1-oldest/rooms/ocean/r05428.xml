  <ShortDescription>You are on Hafnia Mountain Road just north of the Phexton Bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road climbs through some very steep mountain passes to the northeast,
but drops swiftly if you are going south.  There is snow here all year 
round.  Several smaller trails seem to converge on the road at this point.</LongDescription>
