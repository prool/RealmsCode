  <ShortDescription>You are high on the southern slope of Glabor Gulley, near a rock outcropping.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>there are a lot of three-toed footprints in the soft dirt of the path, and
from time to time you can hear the harsh tongue of the mountain trolls.
The trail splits here, allowing you to either go down to the gulley floor,
or climb higher to the rockcropping.</LongDescription>
