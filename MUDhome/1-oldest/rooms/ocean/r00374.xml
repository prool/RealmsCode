  <ShortDescription>You stand high on a bird cliff looking down on a snow white beach.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The island jungle is at your back as you look out over the beach and the
Respitial Sea to the east.  There is the remains of a rutted road here,
leading through the trees and into the wet and dark jungle.  It looks like
you might be able to climb down to the beach, but probably won't be able
to climb back up here again.  At least, not at this point along the cliff.</LongDescription>
