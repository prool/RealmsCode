  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking along Nagaritha Drive, south of the Grape Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Circle-Bar Butcher is located on the south side of the road, providing
meats of various cuts from their ranch to the general public.  On the north
side of the road is the Chateau Richland Grape Orchard, where, as one 
would guess, grapes are grown and harvested.  The grapes are then pressed
and fermented into wine.</LongDescription>
