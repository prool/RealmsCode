  <ShortDescription>You are in the main hallway running through the Mayor's Office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lavishly decorated hallway contains many portraits of the many mayors
of Oceancrest, beginning with Millwood of Uxtiva.  The halls are said to be
haunted by the second-to-last Mayor of Oceancrest, also ironically named
Millwood.  It is also said that Millwood is a lich, and therefore no life
insurance claims have been paid to his heirs, and will not be until he is
proven to be dead.  The office is pretty desolate now, and seems abandoned.</LongDescription>
