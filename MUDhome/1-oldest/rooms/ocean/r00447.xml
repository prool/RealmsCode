  <ShortDescription>You are on Adlermann Way, between Al's Woodwork and the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Al's Woodwork provides a number of interesting, but otherwise useless wood
statues and other carvings to decorate homes and castles.  He is supposed
to know a lot about the wood, though, and claims wood spirits inhabit
all the wood growing inside the city of Oceancrest.  All the wood he uses
comes from outside the city.</LongDescription>
