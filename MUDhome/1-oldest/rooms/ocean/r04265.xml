  <ShortDescription>You are in the dusty library of Prince Rutger's Tower Castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evidently the people who live here in the castle don't do much reading,
as there is a heavy coat of dust everywhere.  The dust is so heavy you 
cannot read the titles of the books and manuscripts stored here.</LongDescription>
