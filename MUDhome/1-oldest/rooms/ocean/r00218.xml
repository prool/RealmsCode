  <Name>Musty Basement Entrance</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the entrance to an old, rarely used basement.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a ladder leading up to the hatch from which you entered the
basement.  Loud and disturbing creaking noises can be heard from all
around you, except that it's completely dark so you don't know where
they are coming from.  The basement opens up toward the west.</LongDescription>
