  <ShortDescription>You are in the Hall of Heros in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oil paintings of famous fighters and paladins are on the wall, each hung
above a huge chair sitting on a raised dais.  The ceiling is so high above
that birds fly about the room, nesting in crannies and niches.  The floor
has a rich multi-hued oriental rug running the length of the hall.  To the
east is the throne room of Prince Ragnar.</LongDescription>
