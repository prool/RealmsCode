  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, south of Keslar Mountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Monument Avenue barely survived the creation of Keslar Mountain, which
was created some centuries ago when the Mages of Keslar decided that a
mountain would look nice here.  High on top of the mountain is the
Palace where many of the mages still reside.  There is a spooky path
up to the Palace on the other side, off of Kafkan Way.</LongDescription>
