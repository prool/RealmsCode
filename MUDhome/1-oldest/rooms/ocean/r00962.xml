  <Name>The Widow Maker Main Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the starboard side of the large pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The pirates are rather restless, but will allow people to wander around
their ship so long as they don't go below deck or up to the aft deck.
Nevertheless, they still don't much care for people mucking around with
their stuff.</LongDescription>
