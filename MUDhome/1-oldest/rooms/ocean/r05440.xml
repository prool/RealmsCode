  <Name>Hafnia Mountain Road/Nyyron Trail Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the junction of the Nyyron Trail and the Hafnia Mountain Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road continues to follow a twisting and turning route as it makes
its way through the great canyon, while the Nyyron Trail cuts off more to
the south.  A faded sign warns travelers that mountain trolls have often
been sighted along the north Nyyron Trail.  A creek flows from the north.</LongDescription>
