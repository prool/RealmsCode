  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, near the Southern Entrance to Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Southern Entrance to Oceancrest is just south of Golden Dolphin Way.
Although security is fairly lax, not just anyone may enter the city 
without the proper papers in order.  Leaving the city is just as 
important, as without the proper papers, you may not be able to get
back in.  On the east, there is a rowdy-looking tavern called "The
Rusty Nail Saloon", which appears to be filled with drunk travelers
having a drink before continuing on the road.  To the west is a large
center known as Leonardo's Foundry, where metals may be converted to
useful weapons and armor for sale. </LongDescription>
