  <ShortDescription>This is the southeastern side of the Garden Circle Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dark forests grow almost to the edge of the City here.  To the south
you can see the famous Kista Forest, a dense oak and pine growth that
provides much of the lumber and hardwood for the city.  There is a mill
not far to the south, but after that there is simply wild woods.</LongDescription>
