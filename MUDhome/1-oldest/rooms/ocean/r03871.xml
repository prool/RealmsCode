  <ShortDescription>You are on a ledge which spirals around the circular walls of the cistern.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cistern is lined with a ceramic brick, making a smooth surface for
the circular well.  The ledge you are on spirals around the wall, but
provides very little in the way of hand holds.  From here, its still a
long way in either direction, up or down.  Although there is a bright
sky up above, there is very little light here, and even less below you.</LongDescription>
