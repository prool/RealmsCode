  <ShortDescription>You are on Lelion Way, just east of Leviathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road is a dense stand of trees so thick you
cannot see more than a few meters that way.  Tree branches overhang
the road, making it quite shady along here.  There are apple trees to
the south, but they are not quite so dense in that direction.</LongDescription>
