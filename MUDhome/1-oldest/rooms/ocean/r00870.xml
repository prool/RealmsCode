  <ShortDescription>You are on a worn path between the street and a grove of trees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path is rather crooked, so you cannot see very far in either direction,
but the city street appears to be to the east.  A large grove of trees to
the west looks like it may be a campground of some sort.  You can hear
music in that direction, and the sound of merry voices.</LongDescription>
