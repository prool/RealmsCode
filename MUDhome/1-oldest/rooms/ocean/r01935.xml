  <ShortDescription>Welcome Rangers to the Riverdell Center for Tracking and Training.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large complex to the east provides you with the best training 
facilities for rangers through the fifteenth level and beyond.  Only
Rangers may enter the park to work on their skills.  All training
locations are well hidden, so you must use your tracking and searching
skills to find them.  Once you have entered the park, you must find one
of the training locations before you can leave.</LongDescription>
