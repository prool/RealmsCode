  <ShortDescription>You are in a large musical shop where musical instruments are sold.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Bards and minstrels love to shop at Penelope's Musical Instruments Shop
because of all the unique instruments she stocks.  A number of the larger 
instruments can also be used in self-defense, but usually end up 
breaking after knocking someone over the head.  </LongDescription>
