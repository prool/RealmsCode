  <Name>Top of a Brick Cistern</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are atop a circular brick cistern and can hear water splashing below.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking down you see a narrow ledge which winds around the circular well,
giving access to the dark waters below.  There doesn't seem to be any
handrails, and the sides are quite slippery with moss.  A pebble dropped
over the side takes a long time to splash in the water below.</LongDescription>
