  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, west of Oceanview Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small shopping complex to the north appears to have three buildings
along the south end of the block.  Directly to the north, you can see
Denise's Imported Elven Silks shop.  Elven materials are not all that
uncommon in Oceancrest as one of the largest trading partners provides
services throughout the lands, even deep into elven territory.  It's too   
that the high costs of importing elven material is passed on to the public.</LongDescription>
