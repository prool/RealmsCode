  <ShortDescription>You are quite high on the main mast of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Far below is the deck of the ship, which now looks very small and narrow.
From here you can see several of your friends standing and talking, or
fighting with the ship's personnel.  The crow's nest is higher still on
the mast, and someone just looked at you from over the edge of the nest.</LongDescription>
