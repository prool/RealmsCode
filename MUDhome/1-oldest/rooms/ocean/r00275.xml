  <ShortDescription>You are at the main entrance to the magnificent Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Avatar Ruins were supposedly created eons ago when the avatars of
the gods clashed, creating odd rock formations and even stranger anti-

used against anyone else.</LongDescription>
