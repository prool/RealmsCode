  <ShortDescription>You are below the South Bridge, on the eastern bank.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You spy a small door in the massive bridge pier, but its closed.   Lucky for
you it's not open, because there's a bloody trail to it.  Lying about are
rotting pieces of flesh, and rusted pieces of armor.  Strange that they
haven't been noticed and given a proper burial.</LongDescription>
