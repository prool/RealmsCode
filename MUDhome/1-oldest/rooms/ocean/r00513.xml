  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Rosecrest Street, west of the Ivanhouse Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Occasionally, you can hear shouts of victory or defeat coming from 
inside the stone walls of the Ivanhouse Sporting Facility, where people
are challenged to take on gladiators literally one-on-one, without the
assistance of other people.  On the west side of the road, you can see
the Oceancrest Central Recycling Plant and Reclaimation Center, where
all the trash in Oceancrest is processed.</LongDescription>
