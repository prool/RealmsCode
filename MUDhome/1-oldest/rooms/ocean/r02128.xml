  <ShortDescription>You are in a small theatre-like room with a front stage to the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The set is very gothic and looks like it's inhabited by ghosts and 
goblins.  Perhaps even worse.  The stage and the set are just props
that you can't seem to move, but everything around you seems to be
moving.  Chairs rattle, tables move and small drinking glasses 
tumble to the ground and shatter.  A very scary place, indeed.</LongDescription>
