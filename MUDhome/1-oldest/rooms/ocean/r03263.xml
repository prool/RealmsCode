  <ShortDescription>You stand just outside the Brownhaven village gate on a colorful brick road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The village has grown so much in recent years that it probably should be
referred to as a town or even a small city, but the residents like to
think of their home as a friendly little village.  The great walls around
it have served the village well in keeping out invaders, but they have
also added to rumors concerning what may be untold wealth hidden inside.</LongDescription>
