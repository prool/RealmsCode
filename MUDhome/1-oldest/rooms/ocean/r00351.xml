  <ShortDescription>You are on the Leviathan Dock, on the beach of the Nylandian Bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Leviathan Dock runs west into the bay, providing access to the various
ships and vessels docked inside the breakwater of the Nylandian Bay.  Most
of the bay is empty right now, but a few merchant ships are nearby.  The
near part of the dock is where the pirate ship Widow Maker berthes when
she is in port.  Marina Way is located to the east, and the dock continues
to the west.</LongDescription>
