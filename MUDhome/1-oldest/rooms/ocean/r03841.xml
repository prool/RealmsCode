  <ShortDescription>You are outside the gate of the North Oceancrest Guard Station.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The huge gate is ponderous to open or close, and stays open all day, but at 
night it is shut tightly and the guards peer down from the City Wall above.
A small but sturdy metal door is available for emergency use at night.
It goes directly into the Guard Station.</LongDescription>
