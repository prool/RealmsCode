  <ShortDescription>You are in a small field where a number of the druids are playing games.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's not a lot to see here.  The druids go about their games as if
you did not even exist.  They seem to be playing some sort of variation
of croquet.  It's quite boring to watch so you move on without taking
much notice.</LongDescription>
