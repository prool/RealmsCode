  <ShortDescription>You are at a blocked part of the North Highway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It looks like great boulders have been rolled across the highway, but
who could have done so much work?  The boulders are huge.  Over to the 
east there is an entrance to some sort of park.  The Golgoth Ice Mountain
can be seen in the distance to the northwest.</LongDescription>
