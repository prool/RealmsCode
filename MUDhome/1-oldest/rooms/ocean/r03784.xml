  <ShortDescription>You are on the beach on the northern side of Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The waters of the Lithium Inlet cut deeply into the banks here, and wash
a lot of the gravel and sand down to the water's edge.  The water is cold
and moving very fast as it comes from the Lyanden Lake to the east.  The
Lelion Beach and Park is located to the west, along the southern bank of
the inlet.  A sign not far to the west says, "Explore this area at your
own risk.  The city is not responsible for the actions of wild animals
or birds."  A set of stairs climbs to the south, and up above you hear
the sounds of happy crowds of people.</LongDescription>
