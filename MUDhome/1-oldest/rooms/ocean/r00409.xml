  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Evenborough Way, west of the Evenborough Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lush, green grass of the Everborough Park makes it an ideal place to
sit down for a rest between walks.  It is a long way from one end of the
city to the other.  On the west side of the road, you can see Sir Edward's
Royal Swordsmith, where most of the swords used by the Knights of the Castle
are forged.</LongDescription>
