  <ShortDescription>You are in the sick bay of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Pirates don't really care to take care of the sick, but this is a good
place for the sniveling whiners.  And besides, it's better to put them here
instead of keeping them around where others could catch something.  The
room is small and cramped, and smells like someone has puked in the
corner.  The place is overrun with mice.</LongDescription>
