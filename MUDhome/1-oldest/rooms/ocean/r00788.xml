  <Name>Guardian's Treasure Room</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a smaller section of the Guardian's temple.  The ceiling is
quite low, but you manage to get through.  A glittering object greets
you towards the center of the room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Upon further examination, you notice that the glittering object is in
fact some sort of sword.  However, it's embedded in a large stone idol
standing some eight feet tall.  You find it impossible to get the sword
out of the idol.  Looking more carefully at the idol, you notice a 
necklace engraved in the stone, but it's missing a gem.  It looks like
it's been pried out by looters. </LongDescription>
