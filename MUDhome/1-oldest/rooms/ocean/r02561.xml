  <ShortDescription>You are in the large public room of the Town Hall for the City of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a meeting here every week, even if the council has nothing to do.
The council members get paid for attending meetings, and it doesn't matter
if there is nothing on the agenda, so long as they are here.  Some evenings
they barely have time to call the roll before they all go home again.</LongDescription>
