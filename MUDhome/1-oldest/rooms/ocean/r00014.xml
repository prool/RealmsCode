  <ShortDescription>Goldenrod Avenue continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly to the south, across the road, is the tax collector's building.
The main entrance is on Brownhaven Way, but there is a small side door
here.  Next door is the Boar's Tit Pub, a rather rowdy little pub known
for its strong drink.  A few tax collectors have been known to slip over
for a quick drink during working hours.</LongDescription>
