  <ShortDescription>You are just west of a major intersection of roads.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Dark Forest hangs on both sides of the road, cutting out almost all of
the light from the sky.  The road has dipped down here, so you are in an
area where it's hard to see in any direction. Bird noises and other sounds,
some of which you have never heard before, come from the trees aroound you.</LongDescription>
