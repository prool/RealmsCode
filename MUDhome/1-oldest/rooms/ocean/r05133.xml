  <Name>North Castle Concourse</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the northeast concourse of an acid reeking ancient castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>An expansive archway leads to the ruined remains of the castle's library.
Evidently, the fire didn't do as much damage in there, but most of the
destruction came from the collapsed ceiling.  The smell of acid from the
moat outside is strong in here.  There must be an opening somewhere.</LongDescription>
