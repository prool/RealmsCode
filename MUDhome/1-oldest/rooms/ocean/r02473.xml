  <ShortDescription>You are in one of the many training locations within the Riverdell Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>If you are a level nine tracker or a level ten underhillsman, you may train
here to advance to the next level.  Once you have reached level eleven,
you must track down the next training site.  Subsequent training sites 
will be for a single level only, instead of for two levels, as have all
the previous training sites, including this one.</LongDescription>
