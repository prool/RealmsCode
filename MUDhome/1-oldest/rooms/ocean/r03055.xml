  <ShortDescription>You have reached a dead end in the goblin underground shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The way is quite dark, and the light you have brought with you illuminates
only a small circle around you.  As your hand reaches out to the walls,
you marvel at how smooth and dry the surface is.  Not far from your hand
is a heavy oak door which opens to the north.  The door is bound with
heavy metal.</LongDescription>
