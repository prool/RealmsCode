  <Name>Crystal Alcove Entrance</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a majestic crystal alcove of immense proportions.  You cannot
see the beginning or end of it.  It looks like a giant maze, but you 
cannot make out which direction is which.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you peer into the large alcove, you notice that there is no order or
logic to the design.  You can see an infinite number of exits to the
alcove, but you're not sure if those exits are real or just illusions.
The alcove begins to the north.</LongDescription>
