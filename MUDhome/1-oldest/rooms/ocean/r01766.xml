  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Kafkan Way, north of Lafyette's Blacksmith and Repairs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lafyette's Blacksmith Shop offers superior and quality craftsmanship in the
repair of armor and weaponry,  But Lafyette is a simple man, and does not
guarantee anything.  (Nor do his competitors.)  Like all blacksmiths in the
Land of Mordor, he has an aversion to enchanted items and will tell you it
is difficult to repair items without them losing that special magical glow.</LongDescription>
