  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the backstage area of the Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Visitor are not allowed to come here, so lookout for any guards that may
pass by.  You can find three tents, allocated to the north, northwest and
west.  The one on the north is beautifully decorated.  It seems that it's
the Director's tent.  Although the tent on the northwest is very neat too,
it is much smaller than the Director's tent.  That is obviously the 
Ringmaster's Tent.  The performers usually go to the tent on the west 
to rest and put their make up on.</LongDescription>
