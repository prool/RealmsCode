  <ShortDescription>You are in the metallic, cube-shaped training room introducing the Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Pits of Doom are typically reserved for the most famous and most
powerful gladiators.  What lies beyond the door to the south are perhaps
the most powerful creatures to roam the world.  Luckily, the great
fighters have subdued these dragons and now there are here for your
fighting enjoyment.  You have been warned, and the management claims
no responsibility for anyone or anything in the Pits of Doom.</LongDescription>
