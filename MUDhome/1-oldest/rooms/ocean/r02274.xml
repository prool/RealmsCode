  <ShortDescription>You are in Roman's Iron Works Shop, where you can buy some fine goods.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Roman Iron Works shop is dedicated to cast-iron weapons and shields
that last for a while, but may not do as much dammage or protect as well.
As usual, the price you pay for inexpensive goods has benifits, but also
has drawbacks.  The Roman Iron Works employees are more than happy to
provide you with anything you might want.</LongDescription>
