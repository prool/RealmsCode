  <ShortDescription>You are on the southern side of the circular hallway ringing the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lighting is dim along here, and the hallway is wide and high.  You can
hear the rustle and squeak of bats high overhead.  The closed doors along
here lead to the servant's quarters and a dirty little pub frequented by 
the lower classes who live in the castle.  To the east is a barracks entry.</LongDescription>
