  <ShortDescription>You are traveling through the desolate crimson hallway under the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is not a lot of activity around this corner of the crimson hallway
but the halls are kept very clean.  The glimmering ice shines with a
radiance unlike anything you've ever seen.  The hallway continues to
the south and east.</LongDescription>
