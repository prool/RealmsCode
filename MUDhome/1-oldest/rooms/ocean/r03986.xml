  <ShortDescription>You are in the store room of Trantori, the High Invoker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's not much in here except a pile of dirty clothes and a stack of
dull blue balls in a net, hanging from the ceiling.  The blue balls look
to be the sort that carry enchantments, but these must be either duds or
ones that are not ready yet.   They don't have that pretty glow to them.
On a table is a red sash, carelessly thrown there.</LongDescription>
