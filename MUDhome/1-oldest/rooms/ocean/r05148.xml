  <ShortDescription>You are in a tiny alcove, and can see a large cluttered room to the west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This tiny alcove offers you a dark spot to stand, and the shadows provide
a place from which to observe the large room.  There seems to be movement
in there, and a flickering fire.  The shadows move about, but you cannot
see anyone other than several large and savage looking black cats.  From
time to time, the single word, "Silventh" floats on the air, and a chuckle.</LongDescription>
