  <ShortDescription>You are on Riverdell Way, taking in the scenery of forests and buildings.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>it's odd to be walking along the street and seeing on the east side of the
road, a number of buildings housing shops and services, and on the west
side, a dense forest.  The forest to the west is very thick, covered with
shrubs and thorn bushes, making it virtually impossible to enter.</LongDescription>
