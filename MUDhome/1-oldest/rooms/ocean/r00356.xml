  <ShortDescription>You are at the southern end of Rum Road, the only road in the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Wagons are pulled up to the double doors of the old wooden building, and
great barrels and kegs stand everywhere.  Some are empty, but most appear
to be full of rum.  All of the workmen you see are dwarves, but for the 
most part they simply ignore you.  On the east side of the road is the
Red Dog Saloon, one of the most popular places in the village.</LongDescription>
