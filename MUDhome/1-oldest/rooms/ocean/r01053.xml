  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Golden Dolphin Way and Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at one of the primary entrances to the town.  In fact, its only one
of four basic ways into town, not including scaling the City Walls.  The
City Walls are constantly patrolled by guards.  Golden Dolphin travels 
along the southern wall of the city going east to west.  Main Street heads
into the center of town, and more immediately, the main shopping districts
of Oceancrest, south of Nylandian Bay.</LongDescription>
