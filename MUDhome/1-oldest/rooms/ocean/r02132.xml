  <Name>East Side of Stump</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of a great forest stump.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path circles around the massive stump to the north and to the south.
High on the remains of the ancient tree that once stood her you can see
where someone has carved something, perhaps a message, or perhaps just
graffiti.  A prickly hedge on the east side of the path requires you to
stay close to the tree stump as you follow the path.</LongDescription>
