  <ShortDescription>You are at the northern end of a hallway on the second floor of the inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>No light comes from the only room opening onto this part of the hallway.
Strange that the door should be slightly open if no one is in there.  At
one time, long ago, the previous owner of the Dragon Tooth Inn was a member
of an anti-royalist group of terrorists.  He kept a room reserved just for
visiting members of the royal family, but unknown to them it had a secret
passage which allowed terrorists to murder the occupants.  Now there is a
rumor that the ghost of a Viscount keeps a room here, waiting for revenge.</LongDescription>
