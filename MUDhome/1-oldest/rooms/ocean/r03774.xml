  <ShortDescription>You are on the walkway on the northern side of the Lithium Inlet.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are inside a wildlife preserve that takes up most of the northern
part of the Lelion Beach and Park.  The walkway continues to the east 
and west, and seems to rise toward the west where the Nylandian Bay is
located.  Across the inlet you see a number of shops and stores in the
northwest section of Oceancrest.  There are heavy woods to the east,
and a walkway to the south that rises above the tree tops.</LongDescription>
