  <ShortDescription>You are on Nagaritha Drive, which runs east and west through town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north of Nagaritha Drive, you can see the Oceancrest Public 
Amphitheatre.  There are two stages that you can see, but they can
combine into one when a really large event takes place.  Around dusk,
most of the people come out from their day jobs and have dinner there
among friends while being entertained by travelling minstrels and 
bards.</LongDescription>
