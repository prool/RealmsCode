  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on the Nyyron Trail near an old tower, which is west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Heavy vines cover the ancient tower, and a fallen stone blocks the only
doorway.  However, if you are interested in exploring, it looks like the 
vines are heavy enough to climb, and you could probably make it to the top.
Further south is a small glen and a burned out house and barn.</LongDescription>
