  <LongDescription>The Iilandi University is a more or less privately funded school which
promotes academics in all fields of study, but mostly technology.  Directly
to the west, you can see the Oceancrest Technological Research Facility
where mystical phenomena like earthquakes are studies and recorded.  On
the east side of the road are the Highland Stables, where guests of the
town may leave their horses while visiting.</LongDescription>
