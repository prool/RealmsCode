  <ShortDescription>You are on Wakeforest Drive, which cuts through the Wakarimasu Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you approach the northern end of the park, you see that a heavy brush 
and thick trees block off what you can see.  This protective cover on the
north side of the park prevents people from seeing the real purpose of
the park, which is actually a shrine to ancient oriental gods.</LongDescription>
