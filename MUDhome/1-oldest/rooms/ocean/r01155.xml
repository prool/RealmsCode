  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, unaware of the events around you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Oceancrest Central Arena is located to the west of here.  The
giant complex is designed to challenge the bravest of warriors in bloody,
hand-to-hand combat.  It is rumored that there are even some dragons in
here that may be called upon to do battle in the name of entertainment.
To the east, you can see the Khelleva Stables, the entrance to which
is located off of Khelleva Drive.</LongDescription>
