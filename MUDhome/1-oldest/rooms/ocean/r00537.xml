  <ShortDescription>You are on Lelion Way, sickened by the smell of the Lyanden Swamp.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large swamp on the north side of the road is formed by the collection
of stale water in the basin as a result of building Lelion Way.  Normally,
the water would exit to the ocean, but poor planning resulted in a sort of
artificial dam, which left the area underwater.  On the south side of the
road are a number of shops in a large complex.</LongDescription>
