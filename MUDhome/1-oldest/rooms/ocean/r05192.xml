  <ShortDescription>This is Galgorie Hill, the site of the three day battle between Galgorie and
the nameless monster from the pond.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Many were the onlookers that day, as Galgorie fought against the multi-armed 
monster.  At the end of the three days, they saw the monster slide lifeless
back into the pond from whence it came.  Galgorie lived for another day,
cradled in the arms of his beloved.  He was buried nearby.</LongDescription>
