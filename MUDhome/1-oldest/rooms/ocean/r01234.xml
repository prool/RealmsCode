  <ShortDescription>You are casually walking along Lankshire Parkway, west of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Just walking next to the large Necropolis sends shivers down your spine.
The large Necropolis must cover nearly ten city blocks and is packed with
more dead bodies than the mind can comfortably imagine.  The large metal
bars separate the road from the Necropolis to prevent grave robbers and
other raving lunatics from defacing the graves and tombs.</LongDescription>
