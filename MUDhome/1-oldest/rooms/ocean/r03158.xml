  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the port side, near the bow, of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Captain Morgan's ship, the Snap Dragon, appears to be in excellent
condition except for the large hole in the side which sank it.  There
are no traces of barnacles or other sea creatures that you would expect
to find on a sunken ship.  Even stranger, the skull and crossbones flag
is still on the mast, wavering in the tide.  You wonder whatever happened
to the crew of this ship.</LongDescription>
