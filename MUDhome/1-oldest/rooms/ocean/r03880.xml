  <ShortDescription>You are wading in an ancient aquaduct under the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The way is dark and the walls are slimy to the touch.  As you wade through
the cold water, you realize something alive is in the stream and keeps
bumping you gently, perhaps out of curiosity, or perhaps trying to decide
if you would be good to eat.  The brick-lined walls are getting wider to
the east, and there might be a landing in that direction before the waters
empty into an underground lake in that direction.</LongDescription>
