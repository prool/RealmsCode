  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Kafkan way, enjoying a day in the city of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The city is very serene and peaceful near the Riverdell Tranquility
Park, which is probably why the park got its name.  The University
is also in the neighborhood, further to the east.  On the south side
of the road is the Oceancrest Mountaineers Supply, a store where any
number of specialized items may be purchased.</LongDescription>
