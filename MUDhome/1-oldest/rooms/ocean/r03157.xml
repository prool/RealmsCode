  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the port side of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oddly, all of the rigging is still in place and the sails are unfurled
as if the ship were underway.  The ship is taut and clean, ready for
inspection except for the cannon holes which pierced her side and sunk
her.  Captain Morgan was quite proud of the Snap Dragon.</LongDescription>
