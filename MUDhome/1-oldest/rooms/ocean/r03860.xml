  <Name>Jungle Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a overgrown path through the jungle near the Uland village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not far from here is the village on Uland Island, but this is almost a
different world.  You are surrounded by thick jungle growth forming a
tunnel path through the vegetation.  The path generally takes an east
to west direction, and to the north you can see a few buildings.  In all
the other directions, there is nothing but jungle.</LongDescription>
