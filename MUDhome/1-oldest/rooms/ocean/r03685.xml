  <Name>Tower Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a stone vault with no apparent exit except small and dark steps.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The steps lead down into quiet blackness, the only way out.  There is a
ledge overhead and you can see the wall is set back a few meters from there
to the ceiling.  You could probably climb up there if the walls were not so
slippery with slime and fungus.  But why would you want to?</LongDescription>
