  <Name>Hobar's Second Hand Store</Name>
  <LongDescription>You are in the shop of Hobar, eldest son of Granovetter the dwarf.
All about you are pieces of farm equipment, armor, old furniture, strange
pieces of scientific apparatus, and just plain junk.  One wall seems to be
ocvered with an assortment of weapons.  Looks like Hobar will buy just about
anything, but does he ever sell any of this stuff?</LongDescription>
