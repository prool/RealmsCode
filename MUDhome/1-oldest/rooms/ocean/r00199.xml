  <ShortDescription>This is a storage room where customers keep their valuables while visiting.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Madame Ruthie has a rule that the only way you can leave this room is
totally naked, prepared for a little action.  Her motto is keep 'em moving.
There are a number of valuable pieces of armor and weapons in here, but
it would probably make someone mad if you took what isn't yours.  When he
remembers to do it, a drunken old dwarf will retrieve your clothes and armor
for you, and return them to you when you leave, if you have paid your bill.</LongDescription>
