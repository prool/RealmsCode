  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Monument Avenue, just east of the Allakaren Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the Allakaren Circle to the west and the interesting Tree of
Life that the Circle surrounds.  The tree has been in that same place 
as far as people can remember into the past, and was rumored to be the
sacred tree of Allakaren himself.  Allakaren is the pharaoh of the ancient
lands that would later (much, much later) become Oceancrest.  A monument
to his great existance still stands on the southeastern corner of the town.</LongDescription>
