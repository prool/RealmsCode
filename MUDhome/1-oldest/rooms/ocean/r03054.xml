  <ShortDescription>You are travelling in a dark, quiet passage towards the western section
of the underground goblin shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage is devoid of all light except for what light you bring with you.
In the dim light, you notice the floors and walls in the musty old corridor
are smooth and highly finished, like the passage had been bored.  There is
a slight breeze, which you can feel on your cheek, which is definitely
coming from the east.</LongDescription>
