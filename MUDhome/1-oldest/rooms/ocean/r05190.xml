  <ShortDescription>You are on a wide road, north of Castle Ragnar.  A copse of trees is nearby.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A wonderful white castle, with spires and turrets and snapping banners and
pennants is immediately south.  It looks to be a very busy place, with  
many people coming and going.  The trees to the east are near a placid pond.
Immediately north is a toll booth for the Lyanden Road.</LongDescription>
