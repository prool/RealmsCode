  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, running through the central shopping district.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Waterfront Way runs through the southwestern shopping district, which is
one of the larger areas dedicated to commerce.  Most of the items for 
sale here are very rare and expensive, compared to other places in 
Oceancrest.  To the north are two large buildings which run parallel
to Oceanview Drive and Main Street respectively.  The one directly
north of here appears to be a hunting supplies store.  </LongDescription>
