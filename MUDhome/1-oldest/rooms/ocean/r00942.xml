  <ShortDescription>You are in the main shopping district of the city of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the end of the shopping district.  The city starts to calm
down as you begin to reach its outskirts.  To the north, you see a
weapons shop and to the south, a polearms retailer.  You are curious
why such peaceful elves would be selling such deadly weapons.</LongDescription>
