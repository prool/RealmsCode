  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Marina Way, between Netherworld Lane and Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Marina Way continues to the north and south, intersecting Main Street to
the north and Netherworld Lane to the south.  On the west side of the road,
you can see a large pub called the Grinning Sailor, filled with sailors
and other marine personnel.  It looks like it could get pretty rough in
there.  On the east side of the road is a small block of shops, accessible
from Main Street.</LongDescription>
