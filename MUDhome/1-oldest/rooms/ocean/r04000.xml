  <LongDescription>You are edging along a narrow walkway inside an underground bubble.  
You seem to be going in circles around the inside of this wierd bubble.
For what purpose was this bubble created?  Why is the sky blue?  What  
is that red glow at the center of the bubble?  Why does evil exist?
Why, why, why?</LongDescription>
