  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Kafkan Way and Riverdell Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Iilandi University lies to the east of the intersection on
both corners.  On the southeast corner is the University Library and on
the northeast corner is the Odinialli Memorial Administration Building.
Much of the University is privately donated and funded as the city does
not take a great interest in the school, except when it is up for various
honors, which it receives quite often.</LongDescription>
