  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of two hallways, deep under the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The main hallway continues to the north and south, while an equally wide
hallway breaks off to the east.  Both hallways are very quiet.  Nor can
you hear the movement of rats or other vermin through the desolate
caverns.  As you head to the north or east, it also starts getting dark.</LongDescription>
