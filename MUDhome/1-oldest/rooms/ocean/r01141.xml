  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, just west of Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hillcrest Drive runs between the Dragon Tooth Inn, a very luxurious
inn for the wealthy travelers, on the north, and the Temple of the 
Rising Moon, a clerical order of balance, to the south.  The Temple
cannot be reached from this side; the entrance is off of Regalia Drive,
one block to the south.  The entrance to the Dragon Tooth Inn is 
located to the west, and around the corner to the north.</LongDescription>
