  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, north of a very large intersection.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large intersection to the south brings together three main roads in
Oceancrest: Rosecrest Street, Eidenhoft Boulevard and Waterfront Way.
You can see Eidenhoft Boulevard to the east as it is running northeast
from the intersection, creating a small sliver of a park between the
two roads.  There is quite a bit of laughter and screaming to the north.</LongDescription>
