  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Golden Dolphin Way and Lankshire Parkway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lankshire Parkway runs north from Golden Dolphin Way.  Golden Dolphin Way
marks the southern border of the city of Oceancrest.  The large City Walls
loom in the background to the south, preventing unwanted people from 
entering the city and preventing criminals from leaving.  The city is
more or less self-sufficient and does not depend on caravans and other
trading for its survival, although smaller cities depend on Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
