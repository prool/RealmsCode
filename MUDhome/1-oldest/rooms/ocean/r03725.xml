  <ShortDescription>You are on the landing of the grand stairway in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Below you is the foyer and the registration desk for the inn, and looking
north you see the vestibule at the main entrance.  Above you is a hallway
going to the west.  The carpet beneath your feet is a deep, dark, wine red
plush and matches the beautiful velvet draperies on the wall.  A polished
mahogany rail runs around the landing, and a locked closet door is in the
south wall.</LongDescription>
