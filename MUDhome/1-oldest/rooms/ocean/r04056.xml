  <ShortDescription>You are on the garden path on the south side of Granovetter's Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the west is the large yard in front of the inn, and to the east you
see one of the newer buildings in this small village built around the old
inn.  A good smelling garden is on both sides of the path you are on.  The
innkeeper's daughter sells some very potent herbs that she grows herself. </LongDescription>
