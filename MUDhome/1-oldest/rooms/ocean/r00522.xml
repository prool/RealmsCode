  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Marina Way, west of the Regal House of Silver.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Silver is a valuable commodity in Oceancrest, although not as valuable
as gold or as useful as adamantine.  Nevertheless, the Regal House of
Silver does some fine craftsmanship in weapons, armors and even some 
fancy houseware items like candlesticks and silverware.</LongDescription>
