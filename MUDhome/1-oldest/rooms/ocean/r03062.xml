  <ShortDescription>You are in Bythme's private bedroom.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you entered the room, several small and naked female goblins were
startled by your presence and fled out the door.  An unmade bed takes
up most of the room, and piles of clothing and goblin religous objects
seem to take up the rest of the it.  Regardless of how powerful the high
priest Bythme is, his housekeeping skills are not good.  he seems to like
very young females, too, although he is one of the oldest goblins alive.</LongDescription>
