  <ShortDescription>You are in Kuroth's Tunnel beneath the Hanging Gardens of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The air is damp and makes it hard for your lungs to draw in a breath.
You find yourself gasping from time to time.  This tunnel seems to have
doors about every ten meters that are self closing and locking.  Kuroth
never meant for anyone to be here, but he took no chances.</LongDescription>
