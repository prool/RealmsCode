  <Name>Leviathan Drive/Netherworld Lane Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Netherworld Lane and Leviathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Leviathan Drive runs north and south from one end of town to the other.  
Most notably, Leviathan runs on the west side of most of the major parks
and natural facilities.  Much of this land was set aside by the town to
preserve the natural beauty of the land without giving up the protection
of the City Walls.  Netherworld Lane gets its name because it passes along
the north side of the eerie Necropolis, located a block to the west.</LongDescription>
