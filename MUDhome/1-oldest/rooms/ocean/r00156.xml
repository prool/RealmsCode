  <ShortDescription>You are on Plasnelt Road, just north of the Brownhaven Disposal Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are several wagons pulled up at the gate, and some are waiting to
enter while a few are just leaving.  There is a gatekeeper holding a key
and waving the wagons through.  Looks like there is a small administration
building for the disposal pits just to the east.  On the north side of the
road there is a stone cutter's place of business.  A sign says, "Why not
order your tombstone while you can enjoy it?"</LongDescription>
