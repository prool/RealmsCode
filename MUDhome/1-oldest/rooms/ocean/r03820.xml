  <ShortDescription>You are standing inside the Carnival Director's tent.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Director's tent is a pleasant place to stay.  You wish you could take a
break from adventuring and set up your own business.  The tent looks very
comfortable, obviously Pavlovich-Barnum has good taste.  Oriental objects
hang all over the walls, his desk is made from abanosian wood, his chair
is beautifully carved from white brezza.  The Director is wearing expensive
clothes with diamond buttons and cuffs.  Unlike you, he wears 16 rings -
two on each finger.  "He must be really rich!" you think.</LongDescription>
