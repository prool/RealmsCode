  <ShortDescription>You are in the DeNail Corn Fields, scaring away crows and other pests.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The corn smells sweet in the warm air.  Crows are constantly picking at
the corn and your job is to scare them away.  The corn field is very 
large and seems to expand in all directions.  The stalks are so tall,
you can hardly see over the top.  It's even worse if you're already
short.  Occassionally, you'll see some farm workers hauling away the
corn.</LongDescription>
