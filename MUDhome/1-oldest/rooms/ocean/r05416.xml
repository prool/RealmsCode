  <ShortDescription>This is the lower trail which goes to the dwarven village of Nyyron.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dwarves don't mind visitors to their small community, so if this is
your first time to their mining town, be sure to stop at the Hog's Breath
Saloon for some good Uland rum and a talk with the bartender.  He knows the
complete history of the area.</LongDescription>
