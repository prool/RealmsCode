  <ShortDescription>You are in the spacious ball room of a popular bawdy house.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A loud and drunken party is taking place, and a piano is being played loudly
in the corner of the grand room.  A wide stairway leads upstairs, and a
veranda runs around the entire outside of the house.  Through the south
french doors you see a view of the bay and a long dock where a pirate
ship is moored.  Most of the men are crew members from that ship.</LongDescription>
