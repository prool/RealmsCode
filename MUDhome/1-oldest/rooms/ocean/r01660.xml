  <ShortDescription>You are on Regalia Way, just southwest of the Allisk Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can see the odd Allisk Circle to the northeast.  A strange feeling
comes over you as you stare in that direction, almost as if you were 
being watched.  The Allisk Manor extends as far as the Allisk Circle.
Both Lankshire Parkway and Hillcrest Drive form the Manor's deathly 
boundaries.</LongDescription>
