  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, just east of the Mortuary.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Davis Brothers Mortuary lies to the west of here.  It is typically
where most of the deceased end up when they die, it being one of the
few funeral arrangement centers in Oceancrest.  The large villa to the
east is the Odgen Family Estate.  The large fountains to the south 
are made of finely crafted marble and gold.  Although this is one of the
smaller villas in Oceancrest, the Odgen Family is one of the richest.</LongDescription>
