  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Main Street, which runs north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are getting close to Nylandian Bay; you can smell the warm salt
water and can hear the sounds of ship horns in the distance.  This
section of town also houses the administrative offices of Oceancrest.
Directly to the west is the Oceancrest Guard Crime Patrol Headquarters.
The city guards on patrol look pretty mean, but they do keep the streets
safe for the public.  To the east is the entrance to the Oceancrest 
Arena Events and Information Center.  </LongDescription>
