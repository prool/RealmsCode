  <ShortDescription>You are stepping as silenty as possible down a dark passageway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At times your footsteps ring loudly, indicating close walls, although you
cannot see them, and at other times they sound dull and distant as though
the sound had nothing to bounce from for a long distance.  Dimly to the
east there is an archway which leads to a library.  A torch set high in
the ceiling gives off more smoke than light.</LongDescription>
