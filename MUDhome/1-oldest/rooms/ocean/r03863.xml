  <Name>Steaming Jungle Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a hot and humid path leading through dense jungle brush.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's almost impossible to step off the path to either side because of
the thick, wet brush.  Low ferns and young palms grow everywhere, and
tall banana trees hang ripe with fruit.  Ancient trees, covered with
moss and vines, stand tall and obscure the light.  The path is dim
and hard to see, and twists around frequent obstacles.</LongDescription>
