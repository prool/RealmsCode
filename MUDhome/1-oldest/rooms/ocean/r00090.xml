  <ShortDescription>Wall Road West continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One of the richest families in the village is that of squire Frebineb, a
very old name in hobbitry society.  The squire's family has lived here since
the village was founded, and his ancesters helped drive off the mountian
trolls when they attacked centuries ago.  Since that time there have been
minor skirmishes, and the squire's relatives have always been the first
to volunteer for the dangerous jobs.  His mansion is east of the road.</LongDescription>
