  <Name>Hanging Gardens Entry</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the southern entrance to the fabulous Hanging Gardens.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Some of the rarest and most exotic plants in the world can be found here.
Ferns and flowers adorn the grounds under giant trees, while succulent
vines grow up the sides of the trees.  There is a heady perfume from almost
every plant, and the air is damp with a fine mist.  The Garden is alive
with the calls of small animals and insects.  Randolf the Blue spared no
expense when he built this place as a monument for his wife.  However, be
warned:  this place is reserved for royalty, and commoners are forbidden.</LongDescription>
