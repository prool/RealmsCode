  <ShortDescription>You are in the central shopping district of the City of Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>More stuff to buy.  The supply store has all sort of useful items for the
mountaineer.  To the south is a potions shop.  It doesn't look as fancy
as the magic shop in Oceancrest, but the elves are not known for their
eccentricity.  The road continues to the east and west.</LongDescription>
