  <ShortDescription>You are at a bend in a the path you are traveling through the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Great Fighters Hall is southeast of here, and the Tomb of Eldritch is
east.  The chill wind brings sounds you really don't want to hear... a
cacophony of wailing and groaning.  At times it almost dies down to a low
moan, but it never ceases.  No doubt it is restless souls turning over in
their graves.  However, as you look around you realize you really don't
see any grave sites near hear, but only a vacant plot of bare ground.</LongDescription>
