  <ShortDescription>You are in a magical glass bubble, deep under the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The bubble doesn't seem to have any distinguishing marks, but is a
great round bubble of glass under the earth.   You are on a small ridge
which runs around the inside perimeter of the bubble. It seems to spiral
around the interior.  A very strong rush of air is going somewhere.</LongDescription>
