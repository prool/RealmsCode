  <Name>Giant Tree Stump</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the north side of a giant tree stump in the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tree that once stood here must have been a world-wonder, if the
girth of the stump is any indication.  Looking up, you see the top of
the tree trunk is considerably over your head, but there may be a way
to climb up there.  The path splits and goes around the tree in two
different directions, and also leads away to the north.  A short
distance that way there is a heavy rope bridge cabled across a shallow
gorge.  The Ashton creek follows the gorge.</LongDescription>
