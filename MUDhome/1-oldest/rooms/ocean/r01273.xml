  <Name>Crypt Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You appear to be at the southern-most end of the cavern crypts.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Both paths lead northward from here.  It doesn't look like they have dug
any new crypt passages for centuries.  Although the crypts are quite
crowded, no further development has occured.  Since the crypt was sealed
centuries ago, no one has dared to enter it.</LongDescription>
