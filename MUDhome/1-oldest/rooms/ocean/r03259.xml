  <ShortDescription>You are traveling north towards Brownhaven, on a paved brick road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This road is paved with large yellowish orange bricks, but you were 
never very good at telling colors.  The bricks look like they might 
have some value if you could pry one out, but they look as if they 
were set by powerful magic.</LongDescription>
