  <Name>Waters Near the Mooring Dock</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the shark infested waters just below the mooring dock.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you thrash in the water, you see various forms of sea life swimming
around you.  You also see the half-eaten remains of previous victims in
the water.  Several hungry sharks have begun to take notice of your 
presense here.  Nearby you see a rope hanging from the side of the ship.
Looks like you have two choices; back to the ship full of pirates, or
swim toward the open sea.  What are you going to do?</LongDescription>
