  <ShortDescription>You are on the Yellow Level in the Pits of Doom Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Pits of Doom are constructed into three levels of difficulty, 
Yellow being the easiest, if there is such a thing, and Red being the
most difficult.  To live up to its name, as you descend down the
levels of the Pits, the danger increases.  It is rumored that there is
a fourth level below Red, but no one has ever survived to verify that
rumor.</LongDescription>
