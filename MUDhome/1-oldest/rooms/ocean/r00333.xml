  <ShortDescription>You are on Rum Road North, the main road through the island.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side you see a large red house, and from here you can the side
yard.  There appears to be a small building a little detached from the main
structure, and you can see steps leading down toward the beach beyond the
out building.  Sure seems to be a good party going on inside.  The road
continues north with a few boarded up buildings on either side, and a
newly painted shop with a sign that says, "Watch for Grand Opening."
When you look closer at the sign, you realize it says this will be a magic
repair shop, but the opening date was last month, and no one seems to be here.</LongDescription>
