  <ShortDescription>You are on the second floor in the west hallway of Kista Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side is another orange painted door.  Must be the same room with
the orange door in the main hallway south of here.  This hallway is not as
well decorated as the main one, but it still seems pretty ornate by most
standards.  There seem to be some offices further north.</LongDescription>
