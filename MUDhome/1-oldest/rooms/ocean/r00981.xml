  <Name>The Cloud Castle Center Room</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a very large room nearly one hundred meters square and perhaps
even that high.  Looking up, all you can see is the blue sky above you.
The cloud castle hallway leads towards the entrance to the west and to
a larger hall to the north.</ShortDescription>
