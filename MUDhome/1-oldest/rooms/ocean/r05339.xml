  <ShortDescription>This road climbs to the east, and drops to the west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road follows the boundary set by the K'tral Desert and the forest. 
there are more hills to the east, and they appear to get steeper in that
direction.  Looking west they apparently level off in the distance.  On the
north side of the road are large pines, oaks and redwoods.  There's nothing
on the south side except hot sand.</LongDescription>
