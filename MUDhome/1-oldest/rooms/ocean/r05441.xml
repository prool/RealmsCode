  <ShortDescription>You are east of the Nyyron Trail, on Hafnia Mountain Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The road has patches of snow in places, which the wind occasionally pick up
and blows in your face, almost laughing at you.  This area of the mountains
is desolate and bleak, and there is no place to avoid the cold wind.</LongDescription>
