  <ShortDescription>The majestic glacier's walls rise up from the cold ice you're standing on.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The ice caverns allow you to see beyond the mountain landscape, into the
massive and seemingly endless Ituk Glacier.  The passage walls glow with
sunlight and reflect your every movements.  Reflections of yourself mesh
in with the strange designs and creatures trapped within the ice.</LongDescription>
