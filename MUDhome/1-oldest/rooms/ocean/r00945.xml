  <ShortDescription>You are on a wide boulevard which runs from the west gate to the east gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The beautiful mountain city of Hafnia is small, but you must remember it was
rebuilt after the war with the dragons and trolls.  Long ago, Hafnia was
much larger but most of it was crushed during the wars.  Some say there
are still portions of the old city deep underground, and that it may be
possible to recover some of the valuables that still be down there.</LongDescription>
