  <Name>The Widow Maker Galley</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the galley of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The aroma from the boiling pots of various foods and soups is quite
appealing.  The galley is fairly busy as the cook and his assistance scurry
to get dinner ready on time, or the captain will be quite upset.  The
last cook was literally thrown off the ship for not having dinner ready
on time.</LongDescription>
