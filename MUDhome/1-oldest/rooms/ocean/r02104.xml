  <ShortDescription>You are in the Golden Shield Shoppe, owned by the gnome Theodenes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Theodenes is an old and wizened little gnome, but at one time, in the service
of his king, he was a mighty warrior.  After he was disabled in combat he
returned to the craft he had apprenticed in as a young gnome.  Today, he is
known as a master craftsman for the fine shields he makes.  Both Prince
Ragnar and Prince Rutger, of the Lyanden line, consider his shields the
highest quality available.</LongDescription>
