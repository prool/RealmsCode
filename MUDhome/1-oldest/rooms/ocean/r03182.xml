  <ShortDescription>You are in a strong current pulling you towards the sea cliffs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The water is decidely warmer than the water in the open sea, and actually
feels quite invigorating.  Although the current is strong, you easily can
swim against it.  The cliffs are even higher here, and seem impossible to
climb.  The waves crash against great rocks at the base of the cliffs.</LongDescription>
