  <ShortDescription>You are at the northern end of a secluded pirate bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The northern end of the bay is perhaps the deepest, and many people
think this is where Morgan's ship went down.  One thing for sure, he
was sunk by the Oceancrest Navy somewhere in this bay.  And it really
isn't that big a bay.</LongDescription>
