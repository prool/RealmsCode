  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, through the Farmer's Residences.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Understanding the need for the farmers of the lands to have a private
residence just like everyone else in town, a small community has been
set up on both sides of Overland Drive for them.  The community is rather
small, but is close to the farming areas and relatively inexpensive to
maintain.</LongDescription>
