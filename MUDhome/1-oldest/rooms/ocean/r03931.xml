  <ShortDescription>You are in a room with silver metal walls, and rows of red rubys.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It is said that each gem in this building holds the soul of a person.  Maybe.
A great many mages, wizards and sorcerers seem to be busy in the building.
Perhaps you could ask one of them.  Reclining on a bright red couch you see
one of the most beautiful women you have ever seen.  Perhaps you could ask
her.  She looks as though she would like to talk to you.</LongDescription>
