  <ShortDescription>You are in the outskirts of the forests of Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you roam around the forest, you can see a number of druids going about
their everyday business.  It doesn't look like they do anything all day
except study.  The druids are rumored to be experts at casting healing 
spells.  In fact, they supposedly are the ones who created the mysterious
philospher's stone.</LongDescription>
