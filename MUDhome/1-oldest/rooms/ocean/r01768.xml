  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, south of the Traveller's Lodge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Crimson Dragon Traveller's Lodge provides accomodations for just about
anyone wandering in from outside the city.  The lodge also provides 
information about travel conditions and possible locations for raids and
other looters.  The eastern gate is the most popular entrance and exit
out of the city, and usually the safest as it is the most travelled.</LongDescription>
