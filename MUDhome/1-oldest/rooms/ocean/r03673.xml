  <ShortDescription>You are near a collapsed and broken wall under the castle of Prince Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A trickle of water coming from the tunnel to the north disappears into
a hole in the floor, gurgling and swirling as it goes.  Looks like the
tunnel continued to the southeast long ago, but now the way is blocked
by a collapsed wall.  Directly south is a castle guard station.  Only
the lowest recruits are assigned to this miserable duty, and they spend
most of their time sleeping and playing cards.  North is a group of cells
where the castle's petty thieves and criminals are kept.</LongDescription>
