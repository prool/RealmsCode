  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are going to have to find land soon.  The weather can't stay like this
forever.  If it gets rough you might be swept even further out to sea, and
thus eliminate any chance at all of ever getting back to Oceancrest.  Have
you ever heard the stories in the pubs of the pirate ship Snapdragon?</LongDescription>
