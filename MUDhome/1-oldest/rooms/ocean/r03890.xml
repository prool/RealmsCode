  <Name>The Tomb of Achunter</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You see a clean, lit room which is the final resting place of Achunter.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A sense of peace overwhelms you as you enter the room.  The undead
of the Necropolis seem unable to contaminate the tomb with their
presence.  A soft glow emits from the center of the the room.  Upon
closer examination, you see the actual body of Achunter himself,
levitating from the floor.  Suprisingly, his body shows no signs
of decay and he seems to be in a state of sleep rather than the
cold trance of death.  In his lifetime, no creature in the whole of
Oceancrest could slay him and in the end, only an intangible force
known only as the "The Erasure" took his life.</LongDescription>
