  <Name>Highwire</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are balancing on a tightrope, very high up, looking down at the tigers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The highwire is the only way to get between the main platform and the left
platform.  It is quite dangerous, not only because of the long fall you
would take if you fell, but also because of the beasts waiting below.
Hopefully, you would not fall into the cage.  Very nasty beasts are kept
there.</LongDescription>
