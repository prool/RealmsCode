  <LongDescription>A very low building sits on a grassy lot to the west.  A sign out front
proclaims it to be the "Center for Research on Anti-Gravity and Levitation."
From here you can see several humans inside the building, all of whom appear
to be wearing white coats and carrying clipboards.</LongDescription>
