  <ShortDescription>You are standing in clear, refresing water at the base of a fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Three statues, sculpted in bronze, stand in the center of the fountain.
The first is a Holy Knight, fully clad in plate armor and wielding a
sword that, even though bronze, appears to flame brightly.  The second
statue is of a priest dressed in simple black robes and wearing about
his neck a medallion with an inlaid skull of silver.  The third statue
is Zelinx, the astonishingly powerful illusionist.  No one understands
why, but he chose to be buried with his tower.  The water washes over
the statues, but nothing can conceal their power.</LongDescription>
