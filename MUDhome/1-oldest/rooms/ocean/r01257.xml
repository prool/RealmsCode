  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, south of the Khelleva Stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Khelleva Stables run east for nearly two regular-sized city blocks.
You've never seen so many horses in your life.  On the south side of the
road is the Odgen Family Villa, a small, but very powerful family who
actually runs most of the town.  They say money corrupts, but if you're
the one with the money, you won't hear any complaints.</LongDescription>
