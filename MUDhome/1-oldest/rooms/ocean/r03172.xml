  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves of a vast sea, hopelessly lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you practice your backstroke you wonder if you will ever see land again.
There is certainly no way to tell which way you should be swimming, so for
all you know you might be headed straight out to sea.  But you have to
keep swimming, because there's nothing else to do.</LongDescription>
