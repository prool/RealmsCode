  <ShortDescription>You are at the front entrance to the Ogden Villa family home.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ogden family is not royalty, but because they have so much money the
members of the Lyanden court consider very carefully any requests that come
from them.  Not only are the family members rich, but they like to show it
off as well.  This estate is a good example of that.</LongDescription>
