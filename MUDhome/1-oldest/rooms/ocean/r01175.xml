  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, west of Rosecrest Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The intersection with Rosecrest Street lies to the east of here.  On the
south, you can see a strangely shaped door into Kaldeas' Mansion of
Illusion.  What is actually in the Mansion has yet to be determined as
it is often different for each person.  It was set up more as a sick 
trick by the crafty wizard/illusionist Mardic Kaldeas some years ago
to discourage snooping around by curious and bothersome adventurers.</LongDescription>
