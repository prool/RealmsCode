  <ShortDescription>You are in a very dis-illusioning place where nothing is what it appears
to be.  The crystal reflects all light making it almost impossible to
find you way around this place.  You have to look carefully for each exit.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's a good thing your compass works because there's no way to figure
out which direction you're going.  All you can make out that iis significant
are the various exits out of the place.  There appear to be an infinite 
number of stairways up and down, but strangely about three times more exits
going down than up.  All the exits look like they're very far away.</LongDescription>
