  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lelion Way, south of the smelly Lyanden Swamp.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The swamp has no real purpose in Oceancrest, but provides a home to some
of the displaced animals that were removed from the land which is now
Lyanden Castle.  The alligators also provide good security against anyone
stupid enough to try to infiltrate the castle through the lake.  There is
a large complex on the south, but it appears that you can only enter it
from the other side of the building.</LongDescription>
