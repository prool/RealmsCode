  <ShortDescription>You are on Leviathan Drive, between the Shrine of Victory and a spice shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trading center on the east side of the road appears to be a small 
armory and a medical supply shop where you can tend to your wounds.  On
the west side of the road, you can see another, larger center where
much of the food that is supplied by the Circle-Bar Cattle Ranch and the
various fields are processed and made available to the public.</LongDescription>
