  <Name>Swampy Path in the Enchanted Forest</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a dark and gloomy path leading through a dismal swamp area.
Moss covers everything, and great water spiders skitter about.  The wet
ground bubbles and burps, and sucks at your boots as you struggle through
the tangle of spider webs and thick vegetation.</ShortDescription>
