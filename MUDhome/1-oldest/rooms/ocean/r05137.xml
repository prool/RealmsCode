  <ShortDescription>You are in the castle's library, which is filled with smoke damaged books.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From what you have seen, the fire raged throughout the hallways, but never
in this room.  The ceiling fell in, making it difficult to move around in
here, and the smoke covered everything with soot, but the tomes and books
are still mostly undamaged on their shelves.</LongDescription>
