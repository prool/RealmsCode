  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Waterfront Way, through the market area.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north, you can make out an alchemy shop which appears to
be venting some blue smoke from its roof.  Another entrance is on  
Main Street, which is just east of here.  On the south, you can see
portions of Leonardo's Foundry, where nearly any metal can be melded
into swords, armors, shields and anything else you can possibly think
of.  The entrance to the Foundry is also on Main Street.</LongDescription>
