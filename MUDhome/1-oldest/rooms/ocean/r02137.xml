  <ShortDescription>You are in the cave of Xandaus the wise hermit.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You had expected rocks to sit on, and perhaps a small fire in the center
of the cave, but instead the place is nicely furnished with old but
expensive furniture.  One wall is floor to ceiling with books and a
comfortable chair is positioned for the best light to read by.  He is
a wise hermit, afterall.  A fireplace and hearth has been constructed of
stone and provides a cheerful atmosphere to the cave.</LongDescription>
