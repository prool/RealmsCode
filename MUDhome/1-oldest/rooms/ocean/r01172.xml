  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, just east of Marina Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Netherworld Lane is wide and busy road which gets its name because it passes
along the north side of the Necropolis, an infamous "City of the Dead"
monument which was built to honor those who have died in battle defending
the city.  The Necropolis is about three city blocks wide and contains a
number of monuments and statues for the viewing pleasure of the public.</LongDescription>
