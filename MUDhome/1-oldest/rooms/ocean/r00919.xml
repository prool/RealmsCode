  <ShortDescription>You are in a rather sophisticated refuse management facility.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you enter the center, you first notice how clean it is.  It still
smells, of course, but no where near as bad as Brownhaven.  As you drop
items in the reclaimation center, it returns money, in appreciation of
not just dumping your junk in the mountains somewhere.  On the wall
you see a sign which says "Thank You For Recycling - Have a Nice Day".</LongDescription>
