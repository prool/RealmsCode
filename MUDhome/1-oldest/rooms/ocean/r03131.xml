  <Name>East Uland Way</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on Uland Way, a very old carriage road, just east of Rum Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The way meanders through a small settlement of rickity shacks and rundown
shops.  The Cold Drake Inn is on the south side of the way, and a bed
and breakfast establishment is tucked behind some banana trees to the north.
East Uland Way continues toward the island's bluff on the eastern side.</LongDescription>
