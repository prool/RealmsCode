  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hofton Avenue, north of the Elven Embassy.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Since Oceancrest is primarily a human town, sometimes, some of the other
races which inhabit Oceancrest feel like their needs are not being fully
addressed.  The Elven Embassy to the south provides a voice for the elven
people to the government.  It also connects communications lines between
Oceancrest and other elven cities.</LongDescription>
