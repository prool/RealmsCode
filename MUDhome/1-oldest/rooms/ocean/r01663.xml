  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Appleton Road, running diagonally through town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Appleton is one of the strange, diagonal roads which travels northwest 
and southeast from here.  To the northwest, Appleton Road heads towards
the Allisk Circle.  Appleton heads southeast towards the city walls in
the southeastern quadrant of town.  Between the road is the Circle-Bar
Cattle Ranch and the Slaughterhouse.  There is a small trickle of blood
running out from the Slaughterhouse on the west side of the road.</LongDescription>
