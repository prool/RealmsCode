  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Nagaritha Drive, taking in the rural scenery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Of course, walking through the farm lands of Oceancrest isn't all that
exciting.  On the south side of the road are the Klondike Wheat Fields,
where more wheat is harvested than the mind can comfortably comprehend.
On the north side of the road is the Circle-Bar Cattle Ranch and 
Slaughterhouse.  More food is provided from this area of town than any
other.</LongDescription>
