  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, east of the West City Wall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north, you can see the intersection of Eidenhoft and Waterfront
Way to Rosecrest Street.  Although it is not a "major" intersection, it
does seem to be adequately busy for this time of day.  On the west is,
of course, the large City Wall.  On the east, you see large building
which appears to house a number of small shops.  The one on the east 
side of Rosecrest appears to be a supply shop.  The storefronts are
facing Waterfront Way and are inaccessable from here.</LongDescription>
