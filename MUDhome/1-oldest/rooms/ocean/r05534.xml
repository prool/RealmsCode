  <Name>Nyyron Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the Nyyron trail, just north of the Hafnia Mountain Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small creek tumbles alongside the trail, making a very pleasant sound.
The dirt path is wide enough for a wagon, but there are no wagon ruts in
the path.  However, you do see plenty of three-toed footprints which look
exactly like troll prints.  Only bigger.  The trail disappears around a
massive boulder to the northeast.</LongDescription>
