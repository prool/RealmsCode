  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Phexton Road and Taragon Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There appears to be a narrow alley tucked in between a brick warehouse and
an old theater, long since closed and nailed shut.  The alley is on the 
northwest side of the corner, and apparently runs at an angle for a short
ways before making a turn.  It's impossible to see very far in the alley.
The village wall makes a right angle turn here.</LongDescription>
