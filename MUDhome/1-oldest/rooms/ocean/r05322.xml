  <ShortDescription>This is the grand road built by King Lyanden before his death.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a militia that patrols this road making it safe during the day,
but they retire during the night leaving it unprotected.  Highwaymen and
trolls are the most common problems at night, so the militia recommends
that only experienced groups travel after sun down.</LongDescription>
