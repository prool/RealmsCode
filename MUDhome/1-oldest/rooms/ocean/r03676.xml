  <ShortDescription>You are on a narrow ledge in a circular well, clinging to the wall. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A faint luminous light comes from the walls, making the room glow with
a ghostly aura.  The ledge you are on travels around a circular well,
which must must be very deep, considering how long it takes for small
debris dislodged by your feet to hit the water below.  You have to inch
along the ledge, but it looks like you can go clear around on the ledge. </LongDescription>
