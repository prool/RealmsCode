  <ShortDescription>You are on Hillcrest Drive, admiring the splendor of the Allakaren Pyramid.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Allakaren Pyramid stands high above the city as it towers 
towards the sky, surpassing even the City Walls in height.  The Pyramid
has withstood the various ravages of time, and remains standing even 
centuries after Pharaoh Allakaren was buried deep within its chambers.
Rumor has it that the Pharaoh still wanders the halls of his Pyramid,
trying to find the people who have stolen treasure from his tomb.</LongDescription>
