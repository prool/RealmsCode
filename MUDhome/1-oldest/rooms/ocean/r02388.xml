  <ShortDescription>The foul stench of rotting flesh and decaying bones fills the passageway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>No doubt this foul place is the home of some even worse creatures who
probably wouldn't mind having you for dinner.  The green covered walls
appear to be smeared with slime and grime, created by the dripping of
water from the glacier above you.  The floor is smooth and a little
slippery.  There is a door to the south.  The passage continues to the
north.</LongDescription>
