  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, south of the Richland Grape Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Chateau Richland Grape Orchard provides for nearly all the grapes
which go into the production of the various wines and juices that the 
Winery makes.  On the south side of the road is the Deep Freeze Storage
Facility where cold items may be preserved without worrying about decay
or melting.  The facility is maintained using dry ice, a relatively modern
approach to cold preservation.</LongDescription>
