  <ShortDescription>You are travelling along Lelion Way, north of the Wakarimasu Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vast park on the south side of the road is the home of many shrines
to long thought to be dead dieties.  Of course since dieties never die,
they still exist, but are not as powerful anymore because they lack 
people to worship them.  </LongDescription>
