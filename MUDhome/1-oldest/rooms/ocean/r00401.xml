  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Evenborough Way, east of the Evenborough Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Inn provides luxurious accomodations for the weary 
traveller for either single night visits or prolonged stays in Oceancrest.
There is a magnificent fountain in front of the main entrance to the
building, suggesting the price of staying here might be a little expensive.
The Evenborough Stables are located on the eastern side of the road.</LongDescription>
