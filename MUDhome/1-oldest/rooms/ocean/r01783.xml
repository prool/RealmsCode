  <ShortDescription>You are on the eastern ridge of the Allakaren Circle in Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mysterious Tree of Life lives in the center of Allakaren Circle, and
has existed at this point for as long as anyone can remember.  It was
thought that the Pharaoh Allakaren once planted the tree and fed it the
blood of his wives when they died.  Whether or not this is true remains
to be seen as no blood has been spilled on the tree for centuries.</LongDescription>
