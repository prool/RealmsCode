  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lelion Way, north of the Fairy Dust Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Many of the town's visitors and guests come from the ocean, primarilly
because traveling by ship is the safest means of travel.  The ocean is
relatively calm and pirates have not been spotted all that often because
the ships always follow the coastline.  Barbarian raiders have been known
to attack caravans and travelers moving across the open plains.  The
Fairy Dust Inn, to the south, provides comfortable lodgings for guests,
close to the Nylandian Bay and the Catlania Docks.</LongDescription>
