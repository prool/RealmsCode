  <ShortDescription>You are standing on the starboard side, near the stern of the Snap Dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Snap Dragon creaks and groans as it rolls slowly with the tide. 
The motion is almost enough to make you seasick, and you feel a little
queasy in the stomach.  A portion of the rail, which you were thinking
of leaning over, is gone, evidently shot away during the battle with
the Oceancrest Navy.  Other than a few battle scars, the ship is really
in quite good shape.  Strange that marine life hasn't taken it over.
It's almost like it's a living ship.</LongDescription>
