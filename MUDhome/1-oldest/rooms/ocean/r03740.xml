  <Name>Tormal's Magic and Wonder Shoppe</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a Magic and Wonders shop owned by Tormal, An elderly mage. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although Tormal is seldom here, his young apprentice will sell almost 
anything.  The shop seems to have anything and everything you might need,
from weapons to armor to wands, and especially scrolls.  Everything has a
price however, but if you are lucky she might give you a discount.  As you
gaze around the shop, you spot some rare scrolls under a stack of dusty
maps on the floor.  And isn't that a dragon blade mixed in with some short
swords?  Hmm..  She might be willing to sell the entire lot for $100.
Tormal would never know, would he?</LongDescription>
