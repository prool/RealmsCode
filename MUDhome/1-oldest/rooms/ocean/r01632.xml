  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, north of the Richland Orchard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The vast Chateau Richland Orchard stretches out for a number of acres
to the south, covered with lines of grape vines.  The Richland Orchard
is always looking for unskilled labor to harvest some of their crops and
scare off pests that come into the orchard looking for food.  The Winery
is located to the north, where the grapes are pressed and fermented.</LongDescription>
