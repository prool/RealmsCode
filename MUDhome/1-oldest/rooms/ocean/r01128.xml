  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Netherworld Lane, just west of Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east, you can see the intersection with Main Street.  Main is one
of the longer roads in Oceancrest which runs through most of the western
side of town.  Netherworld Lane continues east and west from here.  On
the south, you can see Reynold's Drydock, where Darby Reynolds and his
crew construct ships and other sailing vessels.  The business is pretty
lucrative at this time since ship-building is just starting to take its
place in society.</LongDescription>
