  <ShortDescription>You are in the hallway outside the resident mage's quarters.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>When the Witch murdered the duke and his family, the mages who lived here
tried to help, but the witch and her brother were just too powerful.
Although they could not kill the mages, they were able to change their
shapes and imprison them here in altered form.  If you stay here in the
castle long enough, you will occasionally hear whispers and crying.  Be
not afraid of them, but you cannot help them.  They are truly lost.</LongDescription>
