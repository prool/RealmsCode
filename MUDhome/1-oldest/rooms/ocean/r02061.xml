  <ShortDescription>You have entered the main foyer of the Kista Towers.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The foyer is rather spacious.  Down the hall, there are two great oak
doors.  A plaque on the hallway wall says "Throne Room:  Access by
Appointment Only!"  Two hallways lead out of the foyer to the east
and west.  To the south is the large drawbridge that leads you back
out to the city.  There is a very small door also, with a very large
sign over it.  "Keep Out - DANGER"</LongDescription>
