  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Ministry Way, east of the Recycling Plant.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It is very important to recycle in Oceancrest as all the junk lying around
could seriously injure innocent people who accidentally trip over it.  The
idea behind the recycling plants is to exchange used up junk for cash as
an incentive to get people to bring in worn and useless items.</LongDescription>
