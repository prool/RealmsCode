  <ShortDescription>You are on a high and rocky point at the west end of Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are on top of a peninsula which extends into the Nylandian Bay to the
west.  There is a lighthouse on the high point in that direction.  The
city of Oceancrest hires weather wizards to maintain the climate, but just
to be safe, they also maintain a brilliant, magical light out there to
warn ships and help them locate themselves when the fog rolls in.</LongDescription>
