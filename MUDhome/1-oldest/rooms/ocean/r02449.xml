  <ShortDescription>You are wandering through the vast Riverdell Forest, perfecting your skills.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Tracking is an essential part of any ranger's training.  Without the
ability to track, you would be completely lost in such a vast park.
As you continue to walk through the park, you notice how similar all
the trees look and how hard it is to find your way around.</LongDescription>
