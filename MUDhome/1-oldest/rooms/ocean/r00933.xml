  <ShortDescription>You are in a small alley beside Zedda's cape and furs shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Like almost all alleys, this one is pretty dirty and smells bad.  Be careful
where you step.  A lot of the smell seems to come from an open sewer grate
in the center of the alley.  A trickle of dirty water disappears down the
grate opening into the black depths below.  The alley continues to the north
and south, becoming more congested and dirty in the northern direction.
Hafnia Boulevard is south.</LongDescription>
