  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the wildlife preserve of Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A tall fence crosses the walkway to the west, but the gate is open and
you are invited to explore the wildlife area further west.  You would
expect this to be a nice quiet place, form the way it looks, but you can
hear a lot of people shouting and the sound of a steam organ playing
music.  The sounds seem to be coming from the east and farther south.</LongDescription>
