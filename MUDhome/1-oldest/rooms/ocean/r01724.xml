  <ShortDescription>You are in the northern section of the strange Allakaren Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Allakaren Circle is about twice the radius of most of the other 
traffic circles in the city.  This is because the city planners actually
thought about growth before they built the Circle.  Fearing the industrial
growth of the town might hinder the Tree's growth, the Circle was built
with a lot of central space for the Tree to grow and florish, despite
what went on in its surroundings.  A small fence prevents people from
disturbing the tree in the center of the circle.</LongDescription>
