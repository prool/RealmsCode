  <Name>Salvage Boat</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a salvage boat and the captain seems eager to buy from you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The boat is larger than you thought, and appears a little worse for wear,
but it looks quite seaworthy and apparently it can hold large amounts of
treasure.  A couple of nasty looking brutes are guarding the hatch which
leads below.  The captain is followed by a diminitive elf, who has a set
of books under his arm.  He is the clerk, and apparently does all the
buying for the captain.</LongDescription>
