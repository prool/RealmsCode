  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Amberton Lane and Hillcrest Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Amberton Lane heads to the north from this intersection, interrupted a
brief distance to the north by the Keslar Mountain, which seems to have
absorbed the road.  It does connect with Monument Avenue before it ends,
though.  The large Chateau Richland Wine Orchard to the south smells
deliciously of ripening grapes as the sweet smell of fermenting wine 
comes from the northeast.</LongDescription>
