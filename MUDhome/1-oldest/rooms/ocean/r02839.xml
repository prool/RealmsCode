  <ShortDescription>You are on the eastern shore of the salt water, underground lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The surface of the lake is relatively calm, but you notice some sort of
disturbance to the west, near the center of the lake.  It is rumored
that sahuagin roam the salt water lakes and oceans.  These ferocious
demons of the deep kill without mercy.</LongDescription>
