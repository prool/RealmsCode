  <ShortDescription>You are on Wall Road West, just north of the village's west gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side is a run-down little business called the Wayfarer's Rest.
Travelers stop there on their way in and out of the city.  It's always best
to start a journey in the morning hours.  The roads are trecherous during
the night-time, as many of the creatures who prey on travelers do not like
the heat of the sun.</LongDescription>
