  <ShortDescription>Green foothills rise to the east, eventually ending at the great mountains.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the southwest is the hot and searing K'tral Desert, a forbidding buffer
to the even worse badlands many kilometers to the south.  There is an old
caravan trail through the K'tral, and occasionally the desert has swallowed
a few caravans without a trace.  The caravan trail runs south of Prince
Ragnar's splendid castle.</LongDescription>
