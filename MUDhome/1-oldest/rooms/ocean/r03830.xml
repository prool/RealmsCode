  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the back of the Grandstand, your ticket to excitement!</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Grandstand is the place where people go to watch the main attractions
at the carnival.  Many amazing acts of breathtaking beauty are performed
by skilled trapeze artists.  Acrobats entertain with their funny antics.
Dancing elephants prance around with surprising grace while tiger and lion
tamers risk life and limb showing off with their animals.  Be sure to
visit the concession stand if you get an urge for food and drink.  Go west
if you want to get to the grandstand.  Food and drink is to the east.
South is the entrance to the Carnival.  But wherever you go, remember to
enjoy the show!</LongDescription>
