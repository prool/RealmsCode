  <ShortDescription>You have ventured into the darkest area of the Werewolves' Den.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Werewolves appear to come from every direction once they smell blood.  Now
that you have invaded their sanctuary, the larger werewolves come out in
packs looking for prey.  Hopefully, you won't be a statistic in the morning
papers.  The trail outside the den leads east to the front of the Manor and
the gate, and it also leads west to the rear of the estate.</LongDescription>
