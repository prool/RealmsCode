  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves in the vast Respitial Sea.  Far in the
distance to the east, you can see the Nylandian Bay and Oceancrest city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's very easy to get lost at sea because every wave looks like the next,
and the sky is very overcast.  A strong swimmer could easily stay out here
for days.  There doesn't seem to be any immediate danger except perhaps
from the weather.  Right now it's fine, but it could change without warning.</LongDescription>
