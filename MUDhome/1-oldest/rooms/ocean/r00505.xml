  <LongDescription>The Cetacean Bridge, located to the north along Rosecrest Street, connects
the north and south portions of town together.  The Lithium Inlet and
the Nylandian Bay create a natural barrier between the two sections of
town.  As you look to the north, you can usually see a number of playful
dolphins swimming in the warm Lithium Inlet.</LongDescription>
