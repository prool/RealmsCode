  <Name>The Vaults</Name>
  <ShortDescription>Here the path passes around the front of the great vaults.  In the city
it is rumored that a person of vast power is buried here, but everyone
knows you can't just bury a very powerful being.  The massive vaults are 
home to a monstrous lich, so be wary, as its magic controls the entire
structure.  You can sense the glow of some of your magical items grow
dim in the presence of this monument.</ShortDescription>
