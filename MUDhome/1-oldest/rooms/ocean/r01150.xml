  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, running northeast to southwest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Eidenhoft Boulevard is easy to remember because it is one of the few
roads in Oceancrest which run diagonally.  Heading southwest, Eidenhoft
heads towards the Oceancrest Memorial Fountain and other unique monuments
dedicated towards the heroes of the realm.  Further to the northeast,
Eidenhoft begins to straighten out and head due north past the Oceancrest
Central Arena.</LongDescription>
