  <Name>South Plasnelt Park</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the south side of Plasnelt Road, in the common man's park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Actually, when the park was built, the village elders thought of the north
and south parks as simply one park.  It didn't take long however, for the
residents to segregate themselves into separate groups.  The poor people
who generally live on the east side of town come to this southern section,
and leave the northern side to the rich snobs who live on the west side.</LongDescription>
