  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, east of Overland Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Overland Drive intersects Golden Dolphin Way to the west.  The City Wall
is still visible (as if you could miss it) on the south side of the 
road.  On the north side of the road are the numerous, individual houses
of the farmers and their families.  The individual houses were built to
provide easier access to the farms, where they would be working.  </LongDescription>
