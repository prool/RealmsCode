  <ShortDescription>You are high in the sky on the back of a copper dragon.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can no longer see your direction indicator, and cannot tell which way
is north.  You might have to let the great beast under you find its head.
If you start turning, no telling where you might wind up, but of course as
soon as you can see your direction indicator again, you will be all right.</LongDescription>
