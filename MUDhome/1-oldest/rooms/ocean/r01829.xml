  <Name>The Northern Path</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the northern path around the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The northern path curves sharply to the east and south here.  To the
south, you can see the entrance where you entered the Barbarian Pits.
Looking to the east, you can see that the path heads towards the 
Ramdes River.  A giant hedge is located north of the Pits, but you
cannot leave that way.  The heavy brush and steep slope prevent you 
from leaving anywhere except the entrances.</LongDescription>
