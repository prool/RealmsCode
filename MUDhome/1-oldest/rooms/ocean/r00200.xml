  <ShortDescription>This is the entrance to the old, creepy mansion.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Before you to the north lies a large, twisting staircase that leads up
into the unknown darkness of the house above.  To the east is what appears
to be a living room of some sort, except that it hasn't been lived in for
ages.  To the west is another room which you are unable to see very well.</LongDescription>
