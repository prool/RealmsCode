  <ShortDescription>You are on Garden Circle Road, just south of Alturis Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large, thick hedge on either side which prevents people from
entering the Garden at this point.  The entry probably is to the south.
On the west side there is an archery range.  The hedge no doubt protects
a lot of people from being accidently sent back to the Tree of Life.</LongDescription>
