  <ShortDescription>You are on the starboard side of the main deck on the Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The pirate ship Widow Maker is in relatively good condition considering the
fact that it's out at sea nearly every day of the year.  The ship is kept
up by the various midshipmen and other ensigns that haven't yet proven 
themselves to the pirate captain and his officers.</LongDescription>
