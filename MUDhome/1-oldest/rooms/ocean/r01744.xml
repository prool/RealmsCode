  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Wakeforest Drive, east of the Shrine of Moradin.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Moradin is the Creator of the Dwarven Race, and the dwarves worship him
regularly as if the end of the world were going to come tomorrow.  The
fanatic worship of a god has inspired many wars and many victories for
the dwarves, but now they live in relative peace with the humans and other
races of the world (although they still don't really like the elves too
much.)  On the east is the Oceancrest Orphanage.</LongDescription>
