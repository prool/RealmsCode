  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, south of the Healing Hand.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Very few charities give out aid for free anymore, but the Helping Hand
still exists to serve the destitude of life.  Many people go here after
battles with numerous wounds to have dressed up.  The rather small 
facility only holds a couple of people at a time, so you may have to wait
in line if you want to enter.</LongDescription>
