  <Name>Trokkawilff's Dungeon</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in Trokkawilff's dungeon with a full view of his torture chamber.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dungeon is small and has moldy straw ankle deep on the floor.  Several
chains with open manacles hang from the low ceiling, and iron wristlets
and leg clamps are attached to the south wall.  Any prisoner here would
have a full view through the open door of the torture chamber in the next
room.  There is a table in the room, set with a very fine bone china and
expensive looking silver.  The table cloth has long since disintegrated.
A repulsive green slime seems to cover most of the room.</LongDescription>
