  <ShortDescription>You are wading at the mouth of the Sunshine River, a river known for its bone
chilling waters.  The river empties into the east side of Lake Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Hunting and fishing parties have been here in the past, and you see the
remains of a beach camp fire near some large sheltering rocks near the
mouth of the river.  Looking out over the water you can see where the
cold river water continues for quite a ways out into the lake, before
it spreads into the lake proper.  Funny how waters of two different
temperatures seem to avoid each other.</LongDescription>
