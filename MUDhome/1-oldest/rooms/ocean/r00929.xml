  <ShortDescription>You are behind the shops which are on the north side of Hafnia Boulevard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The alley is not very clean, but it is wide.  Most of the shops have locked
doors on the south side of the alley, but the city maintains a Public Works
Department which is located on the north side of this wide alley.  The elves
supervise the work of the department, but mostly they hire gnomes to do the
dirty work.</LongDescription>
