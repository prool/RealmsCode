  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Rosecrest Street, next to the Khelleva Estate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive estate is extended for more than two city blocks to the south.
There is a majestic mansion on the south side of the estate.  From this 
vantage point, you can see the estate lies next to Khelleva Drive.  Not
surprisingly, Khelleva Drive was built by the family to provide easy 
access to the mansion; however, it was never expected to be a large road.</LongDescription>
