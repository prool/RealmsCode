  <LongDescription>This hall is the primary dining area for the servants and guards.  The
food that is served is typically just leftovers of the food which is
served to the mages and their guests.  The food is top quality so on
one is complaining.  This hall is also used for meetings and other
gatherings.  There's also a card table in one corner and a variety of
other entertainment items around.</LongDescription>
