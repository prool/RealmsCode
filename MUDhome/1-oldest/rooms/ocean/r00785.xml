  <Name>Mirrored Hall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a well-lit room surrounded by crystals.  The effect of which
is that you can't figure out which walls exist and which ones don't.  
The reflection in here is annoying yet at the same time mystifying.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Upon careful examination of the room, you find a small note on the
floor which reads: "What to do if you find yourself in a mirrored room
with no exits and no hope of escape.  Consider how good life has been
to you so far.  If life has not been good to you, which is more likely
the case in your present situation, consider the fact that it will not
be bothering you for much longer."  You toss the note down and bang
your head against one of the mirrors.  When you come to your senses,
as often a good bump on the head does to a person, you can somewhat make
out a room to the south.</LongDescription>
