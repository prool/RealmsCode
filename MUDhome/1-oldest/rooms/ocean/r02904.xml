  <ShortDescription>This is the vast wasteland of rocks and gravel known as Avernus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The first plane of Hell is not at all what you might have expected.  With
the exception of some hideous monsters which roam these parts, it's not
all that bad.  Of course, you're still on the outer fringe of Avernus.
Avernus is the most heavily guarded of the planes of Hell, as it is the
gateway plane into the dimension of reality.</LongDescription>
