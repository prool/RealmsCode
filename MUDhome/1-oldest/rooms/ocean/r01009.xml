  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Overland Drive and Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street is one of the larger roads running through the southwestern part
of Oceancrest.  It continues north as far as the Nylandian Bay.  Overland
Drive runs east to west, and is a smaller access road to the large estates
to the east.  The estates are in the more exclusive, richer sections of town
where snobbery is bred in, and commoners are not welcome, except as help.</LongDescription>
