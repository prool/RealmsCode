  <ShortDescription>You are in the clouds on a redwood staircase, winding around a huge tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A rope ladder hangs down to a spiraling staircase below, which disappears
in the clouds below you.  Your's so high, it's hard to see anything on the
ground below you.  There's a message burned into the tree here.  Looks like
Trantori doesn't want any visitors.  "Leave now, or become a toad for the
rest of your life."</LongDescription>
