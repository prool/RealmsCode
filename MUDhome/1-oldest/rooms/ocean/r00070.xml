  <LongDescription>You are at the western most side of the village of Brownhaven, walking
beside a high, brown wall.  The village took its name from the color of
the wall, which was built centuries ago to protect the residents from
the marauding mountain trolls.  A large clan of trolls live to the north
of the village.</LongDescription>
