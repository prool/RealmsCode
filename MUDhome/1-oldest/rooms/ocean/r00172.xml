  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Phexton Road south of a garishly painted pawn shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road is a tacky little shop with three brass
balls suspended over the door.  A sign on the door says, "No questions
asked."  Inside, you see a fat little gnome fingering his gold.  The
village wall on the south side of the road seems to be getting higher
in the eastern direction.</LongDescription>
