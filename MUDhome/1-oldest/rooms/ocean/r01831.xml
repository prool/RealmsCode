  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the central path just west of the Ramdes River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The center path train joins the other trails coming from the southern
part of the Barbarian Pits at the bridge crossing the Ramdes River
to the southeast.  The large river divides the Pits into two sections,
the larger one being on the west side of the river.  Not much lies on
the eastern side of the river except an access path to a deep valley.</LongDescription>
