  <ShortDescription>Congratulations!  You have earned your rank of Grunt, Second Class.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The secret to a good and powerful barbarian is the ability to overpower
opponents that are even more powerful than you.  In order to advance
to higher levels, you must be prepared to fight with a barbarian of the
level you are applying for.  Barbarians don't rise to power by being
wimps.</LongDescription>
