  <Name>The Silent Knife Training Room</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the training room of the Silent Knife Assassin's Guild.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only lower level Minor Assassins may enter this area to train in some 
basic assassination skills.  Once you reach Minor Assassin, First Class,
this center becomes much too simplistic for your talents, and you are 
forced to go out and look for a higher quality Assassins' Guild.  Some
of your brothers suggest a place known as the Rusty Dagger, but are 
hesitant to tell you where that is.</LongDescription>
