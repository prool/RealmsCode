  <Name>Sharkey's Pawn Shoppe</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the secret pawn shoppe of Hafnia.  Sharkey smiles at you as
you walk in and asks what he can do for you.  You see weapons and armor
of all kinds decorating the walls.  Great warriors come here to collect
on their spoils while the desolate sell whatever they can to eat for the
day.  Some say Sharkey has sold used weapons to the trolls.</ShortDescription>
