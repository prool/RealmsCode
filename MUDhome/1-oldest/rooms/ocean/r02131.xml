  <ShortDescription>You are in the mysterious Caverns of Doom exhibit based on some under-
ground caverns and passages underneath the mountains and the lakes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The caves are remarkablly well reproduced here, although on a much
smaller scale than in real life.  There are a number of small things
moving on the dusty, damp floor, mostly consisting of venemous rats
and other vermin.  Every so often, you see some orcs or worms wandering
around in the depths of the caves.</LongDescription>
