  <ShortDescription>You are in a large shop where all kinds of weapons and armor lie about.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several young boys are working the bellows as a stout dwarf hammers out a
sword from a rod of glowing iron.  There is a clerk also near the front
of the shop.  It looks like you can purchase new and used armor here, as
well as get a few things repaired.</LongDescription>
