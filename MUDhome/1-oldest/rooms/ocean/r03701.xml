  <ShortDescription>You are on the main mast of the Widow Maker, just above the deck.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The rigging is an organized mess, which probably makes sense to the pirates
who work here, but not to you.  High overhead you see the crow's nest, a
large wicker basket attached to the top of the mast.  It's there that the
ship's lookout spends his time, watching for merchant ships on the horizon.
Below you is the main deck of the ship, while to either side are the great
booms that carry the sails.</LongDescription>
