  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Tower Lane and Ivory Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ivory Way leads both north and south of here, following a line of trees
that may be as old as the town itself.  Tower Lane leads to the west through
the heart of the city.  There is a large amphitheater to the east where some
of the most renouned speakers in the land are often heard to lecture.  The
facility is also used for entertainment, which usually draws larger crowds.</LongDescription>
