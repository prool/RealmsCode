  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, west of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the impressive City Walls on the east side of the road stand nearly ten
meters high at some points, protecting the city and its citizens from 
attacks and raids from the outside world.  The realm ouside the City
Walls is very deadly and not very fun to visit.  Only the bravest people
venture out into the wilderness.</LongDescription>
