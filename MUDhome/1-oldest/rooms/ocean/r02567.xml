  <ShortDescription>You are in the private quarters of Evan the Most Magnificient. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Actually, Evan gave himself the title since no one else ever considered
giving him one.  Evan probably could have been a better than average mage,
but he had an opportunity to open this shop and became too interested in
making money.  It's a decision he regrets every day.</LongDescription>
