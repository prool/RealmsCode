  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Melbourne Avenue, east of D'Tan's Leather Armory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small armory is located to the west of the road, where everyday citizens
may purchase light armor to use for day-to-day protection.  The armor is not
nearly as strong as you'd like, but for the price range, you can't really
argue.  On the east side of the road is the Bows &amp; Arrows Unlimited Shop
where various bows, mostly made by elves, may be purchased.</LongDescription>
