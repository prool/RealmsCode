  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Highland Avenue, east of the Crimson Dragon Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elegant Crimson Dragon Traveler's Lodge is one of the more popular
inns in the city.  Of course, being as elegant and well-kept as it is,
the Lodge tends to cost quite a bit to stay in for just a couple of
nights.  There are stables to the south where you can leave horses while
visiting Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
