  <ShortDescription>You are in the western hallway of the ground level of the Kista Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From what you can tell, there is only one level to the Towers.  For the
most part, it's just this floor and the large towers looming above you.
The corridor is well kept and seems to be fairly busy with visiting
representatives from the human and dwarven races.  The walls are fairly
bare, though.  Perhaps they ran out of pictures to put up.</LongDescription>
