  <LongDescription>Khelleva Circle is named after the Khelleva Family, who in fact built this
fine architectural circle.  The traffic circle connects Eidenhoft
Boulevard, which runs to the south, Rosecrest Street and Khelleva 
Drive.  The circle continues around to the northwest and northeast.
There is a large tree in the center of the circle that a number of
people have decided to rest under in the warm sun.</LongDescription>
