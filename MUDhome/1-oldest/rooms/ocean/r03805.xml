  <Name>Back Lot Gate</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the gate to the back lot of the Seaside Carnival and Sideshow.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gate is locked and probably the key is with the circus guard you
can see here.  To the east is the crowded midway, and the lights and noise 
keep the mobs in a festive mood.  Looking south you can see many 
spectators watching the Illusionist's show.  Better hurry up before
you miss another of his amazing prestidigitations.  </LongDescription>
