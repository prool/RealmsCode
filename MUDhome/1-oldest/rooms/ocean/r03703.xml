  <ShortDescription>You are just under the crow's nest, looking at the trapdoor entry.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Below you is a dizzying distance to the ship's deck, and from here it
looks so small that if you fell, you might not even hit it, but would
probably take a dive into the surrounding waters.  There is a tangle of
lines and sails just below your feet.  The small sway that you hardly
noticed when you were below is greatly magnified from this height.  It
seems to be making you sick.  Wouldn't it be terrible to erp on your
friends below?</LongDescription>
