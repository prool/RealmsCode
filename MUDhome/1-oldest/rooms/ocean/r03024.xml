  <ShortDescription>You are in a dimly lit tunnel in the southern part of the shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Smoky torches flicker and sputter along the tunnel's walls, providing the
only source of light in a dreary tunnel.  It's difficult to breath such
stale air, and the torches indicate there really isn't much oxygen down
here anyway.  There are numerous cracks and small crevices in the tunnel
wall, some large enough that they seem to provide homes for rats and other
vermin.  There is a rather large crack in the eastern wall.</LongDescription>
