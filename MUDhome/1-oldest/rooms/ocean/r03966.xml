  <ShortDescription>You are in a meadow surrounded by woods.  To the west is the sound of water.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Around are old growth oaks, and you realize that many of them are centuries
old, but still healthy and productive.  Small animals chatter in the tree 
tops, and birds flit from tree to tree.  The meadow too, seems alive with
rodents and other tiny animals.</LongDescription>
