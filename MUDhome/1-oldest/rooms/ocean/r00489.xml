  <ShortDescription>You are on Nissiau Lane, between the Oceancrest Soup Kitchen on the north
side of the road and Steve's Fishing and Tackle Shop on the south side.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Soup Kitchen provides food and supplies to the homeless
and displaced people in Oceancrest.  Although there aren't that many people
so poor that they cannot even afford to live in the housing complexes, 
many can barely put food on the table.  To the south, you can see Steve's
Fishing and Tackle Shop where you can buy fishing supplies, bait and even
book a boat ride into the harbor to do some relaxing fishing.</LongDescription>
