  <ShortDescription>You are in the more exclusive stables of the visiting dignitaries.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The various dignitaries who visit Kista prefer not to have their
horses associated with the other riff-raff that come wandering into
the town.  The facility here is more exclusive and the guards do not
like commoners such as yourself poking their noses around here.</LongDescription>
