  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the Knight's Walk, which is west of here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel seems to have a gradual decline as it goes deeper into the 
castle heading west.  East of here is the main intersection near the
castle's gate and guard headquarters.  Heavy torches set in the walls
on either side of the tunnel seem to provide adequate light.  Looking
west you can see the tunnel does not go far in that direction, but
continues around the corner to the south.</LongDescription>
