  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, near the Southern Entrance to town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large inn to the east of Main Street called "The Golden 
Dolphin Inn", which caters to the average traveler travelling between
cities.  The modest accomodations and excellent food are well worth
the few gold pieces it costs to stay there.  Heading north on Main 
brings you towards the shopping districts of town, where just about 
anything may be bought or sold.</LongDescription>
