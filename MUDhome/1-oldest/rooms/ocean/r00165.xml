  <ShortDescription>You are on East Ulandia, just east of the Baldywyne River, near a small cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The cave is on a vacant lot to the east, and seems to be a tunnel that
heads in the direction of the Brownhaven Garbage Pits.  There's a rotten
smell coming the entrance to the cave.  A little to north of the cave
entrance there is an old wooden shack.  Someone appears to be living 
there as smoke issues from a slender smoke stack.  Even the smoke stinks.</LongDescription>
