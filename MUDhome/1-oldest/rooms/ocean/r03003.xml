  <Name>Southwest Corner of Cellar</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the musty southwest corner of a farmer's large cellar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Old, empty crates are loosely stacked in large piles near the corner here.
A dextrous adventurer could probably work his way back up through the
cellar door by carefully scaling the largest stack.</LongDescription>
