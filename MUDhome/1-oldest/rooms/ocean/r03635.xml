  <ShortDescription>You are near the eastern wall of the great courtyard in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large red and white tent stands just north of you, its tent flap open
and obscured by a blue steam or mist coming from inside.  To the west
is a great expanse of flagstone and marble where you see an odd assortment
of people gathered.  As you look up, you see towers and turrets which 
seem to get lost in the clouds above.  Castle Ragnar has never been
fully explored, and every so often a new room or hallway is found.</LongDescription>
