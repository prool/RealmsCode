  <ShortDescription>You are in a damp and dark cellar, with an odd smell in the musty air.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Tragirsha has lived here alone for almost 180 years, suffering from the spell
of the demon.  She waits for someone to break the curse cast on her, and
has vowed to reward anyone who does.  During the years she has lived here
she has learned much because of her power to listen to the thoughts of 
people who pass by on the road outside.</LongDescription>
