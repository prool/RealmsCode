  <Name>Trokkawilff's Private Chambers</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the never forgotten private chambers of Thokkawilff.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the master torturer died over a century ago, his name is still
a word that brings terror to prisoners of Ragnar.  This chamber is rather
stale and dusty, and all of the furniture has been removed, but some how
it doesn't seem empty.  You have the strangest feeling of someone watching
you, and there is an evilness here which makes your skin crawl.</LongDescription>
