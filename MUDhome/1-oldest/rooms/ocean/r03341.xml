  <ShortDescription>You are at a bend in the Necropolis path.  The Walk of Heroes is south. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From the west there is a grove of trees, strange for a Necropolis, but
indeed, the ground coverage prevents you from seeing what lies beyond
the barrier of trees.  The path here leads west around the Necropolis
and south to the Walk of Heroes.  From the north a cold breeze sends a 
chill down your spine.  it comes from the mausoleum.</LongDescription>
