  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, west of the University Library.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The University Library, with the possible exception of the Oceancrest
Ministry of Knowledge building in southwestern Oceancrest, is perhaps
the largest known collection of books and tomes in the land.  The vast
library contains much of what the Ministry has, but also a number of
more scientific and philosophical volumes which the Ministry has yet 
to accept as valid reading and learning materials.</LongDescription>
