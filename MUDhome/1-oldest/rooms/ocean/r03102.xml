  <ShortDescription>This is Tristram's Temple, on level three of the underground city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>True children of Tristram may rest here, where the palpable glow of
holiness will speed the healing of their wounds.  Unlike the temples on
the higher levels, this temple is not beautiful at all, but dark and
gloomy.  Mists obscure the high ceiling.  A magical rope rises up from
the floor into the mists, with no end in sight.
