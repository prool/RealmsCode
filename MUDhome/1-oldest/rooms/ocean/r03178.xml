  <ShortDescription>You are on a snow white beach on a tropical island, below some sand cliffs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The beach stretches around the island, out of sight, while above you is
a sandy cliff that might be difficult to climb.  There seems to be a
jungle up there, as you see cocanut trees and palms growing up on the
high ground above the sand.  The surf rolls in with a crashing noise
and runs up the beach, wiping out your footprints.</LongDescription>
