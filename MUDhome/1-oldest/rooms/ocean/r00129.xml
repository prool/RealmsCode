  <ShortDescription>You are on Taragon Road, a wide dirt road near some large storage barns.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The barns you see contain food and other necessities in the event of a
long-term siege.  Once, about six hundred years ago, the village was 
attacked by mountain trolls and the residents almost starved before they
drove the trolls away.  Since that time, the village has stored just
about anything you can imagine in there.</LongDescription>
