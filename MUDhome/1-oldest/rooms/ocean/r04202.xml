  <ShortDescription>This is the guard station for the main gates of Castle Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You see a simple desk where you may state your business.  Behind the desk
there are two doors, which apparently lead to a barracks room and an office
for the Lieutenant of the Guard.  Several off duty guards are lounging 
near the main entry door.  They wear gleaming black and silver uniforms.</LongDescription>
