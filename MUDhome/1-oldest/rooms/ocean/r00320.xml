  <ShortDescription>You are on the surface of the Children's Tank in the Bendine Aquarium.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large water pool is quite warm and relaxing.  Every so often, a dolphin
or two will nudge you.  They sort of see you as an invader of their habitat,
but are usually fairly friendly unless attacked.  A number of large fish
and sea horses also swim by.</LongDescription>
