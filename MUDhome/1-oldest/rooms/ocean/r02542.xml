  <ShortDescription>You are on Alturis Road, west of Pearl Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The grand Cathedral of Veratus is on the south side of the road, a
monument to a cluster of gods and immortals who inhabited the mountains
long ago.  The strangest thing about the gods who are worshipped here is
that they are no longer in residence.  Some say they are simply sleeping,
awaiting the time when they are truly needed to save the world.  A single
immortal remains.  She is the oracle.</LongDescription>
