  <Name>Road Guard Barracks Compound</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are outside a barracks for the road guard, near a slide exit.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The guards who man this post don't consider it especailly good duty, and
are often in a bad humor because they would rather stand guard on the castle
wall, so they could be part of the feasting and drinking when they are not
on watch.  The slide exit you see is one-way, and provides troops in the
castle quick access down here if there is trouble.</LongDescription>
