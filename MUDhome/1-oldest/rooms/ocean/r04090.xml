  <ShortDescription>You are in the cold waters of the Ramdes River, being swept southward.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The water is deep and swift, making it difficult to swim in any direction
but with the current.  It looks like the center, being deepest, is the
least dangerous.  There are rocks jutting out of the water along the shore. </LongDescription>
