  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on East Ulandia, on the east bank of the Baldywyne River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Great pepper trees and weeping willows line the bank of the river, and a
gentle, grassy slope runds down to the water's edge.  On the east side of
the road is an open-air market with scores of vendors and milling customers.
Gayly colored and brightly striped tents are set up as vending booths, and
a number of very strange races can be seen.</LongDescription>
