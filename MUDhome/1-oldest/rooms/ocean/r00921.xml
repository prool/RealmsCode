  <LongDescription>Rue Caledonia is the street directly north, connecting to Hafnia Boulevard.
You seem to notice a lot of activity in this area of town.  On the west
side of the street, farther north, you see a caravan assembly lot.  Toward 
the south you detect an unpleasant odor, and notice a road sign directing 
you to the city's dump.</LongDescription>
