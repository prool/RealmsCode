  <ShortDescription>This is Caledonia Road, which is a major east-west street in Brownhaven. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly west is the Town Square of Brownhaven.  Caledonia Road intersects
with Main Street over to the east.  As you look north, you see the famous
Brownhaven Central Library, world famous for its collection of books on
magic and alchemy.  Of course, the most famous of all alchemists once
resided here in Brownhaven, and when his house burned he gave the library
the books he salvaged.  Khallazar has since moved to somewhere in an
enchanted forest.</LongDescription>
