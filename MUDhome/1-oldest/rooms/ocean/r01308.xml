  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Riverdell Way, west of Oolan's Armory.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oolan's Armory is like every other armory in town, but specializes in
exotic leather items such as dragon's leather and shark leather.  The
fancy leathers are not without a cost, though, and they seldom last much
longer than standard leather armors, if even that long.  They do make
a good fashion statement, though, and occasionally Oolan has some really
durable stuff.</LongDescription>
