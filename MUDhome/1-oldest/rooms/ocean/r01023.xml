  <ShortDescription>You are on Main Street, one of the major roads running though Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street tends to be a very busy avenue where just about anything 
may be bought or sold.  Towards the south, you can make out the primary
shopping district of southwestern Oceancrest.  To the east, there is a
large building labled "Sleeping Deer Real Estate".  To the west of Main,
there is a small stable.  There appears to be someone training horses
over there.  A small building is located to the south.</LongDescription>
