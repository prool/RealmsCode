  <Name>Pits of Doom - Red Level</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This level of the Pits of Doom isn't called the Red Level for nothing.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Red Level is caked with the singed blood of past victims.  The most
dangerous and mean-tempered dragons dwell on this level and are always
on the lookout for food.  Since not very many people think about coming
in here, they don't get to eat very often.  Well, at least you now know
that these dragons exist and they're not just some made-up fantasy.  
Whether or not you'll be able to tell anyone may be another story.</LongDescription>
