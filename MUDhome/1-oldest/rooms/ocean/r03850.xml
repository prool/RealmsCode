  <ShortDescription>You are in an irregular shaped plaza known as the Uland Trading Center.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A variety of small shops are tucked into this quaint little plaza of
cobblestones and ancient buildings.  Evidently the owners of several
of the shops live in quarters above them.  Directly east is a friendly
looking place known as the Adventurer's Haven.  To the north is a tiny
little neighborhood pub called the Tail-o-the-Dragon.  It's said that
a retired hero of Oceancrest owns it and entertains patrons with his
heroic tales.</LongDescription>
