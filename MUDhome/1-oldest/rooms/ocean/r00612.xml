  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Avatar Boulevard, east of a rather smelly marsh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The river which flows into Lyanden Lake leaves behind a small marsh of
mud and quicksand in the region to the west, which really starts to smell
after a long day in the hot sun.  This is not necessarily good for the
businesses that have to work here.  There is a large complex to the east
which houses a number of shops.</LongDescription>
