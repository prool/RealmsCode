  <LongDescription>You are on Nyyron Trail, just south of Hafnia Mountain Road. 
The Trail was important at one time, but since the old watch towers were
abandoned after better signaling methods were found, this trail has not
been used much.  In the distance to the south you can see a single stone
tower, overgrown with heavy vines.</LongDescription>
