  <LongDescription>There is a strangely shaped mansion to the south of Netherworld Lane.
A large banner reads "Kaldeas' Mansion of Illusion".  There appears
to be an entrance to the east on Netherworld Lane.  On the north side
of the road, there is a public storage facility.  On a first-come, 
first-served basis, citizens may rent or use some of the storage 
locations in the complex.  The entrance to the facility is to the
north.</LongDescription>
