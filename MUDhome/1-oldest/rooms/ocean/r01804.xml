  <ShortDescription>You are on Waterfront Way, running east and west past the Archery Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dentra Central Archery Range is located on the south side of the road.
You are at the beginner's level area of the range where anyone is welcome
to shoot a few bolts.  The young archers in this range are fairly good 
shots, and come here to practice between school lessons.  It is important
for young elves to learn the art of archery at a young age.</LongDescription>
