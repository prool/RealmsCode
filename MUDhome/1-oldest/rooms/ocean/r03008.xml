  <ShortDescription>You are in a cavernous tunnel forming a long hallway, next to a wooden door.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A soft luminous glow comes from the rock surface, giving little light.
To the east the hallway fades off into pitch darkness, and a putrid smell
floats on a slight breeze coming from that direction.  There's an old
adage about "follow your nose," but was it meant for a situation like this?</LongDescription>
