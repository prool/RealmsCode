  <ShortDescription>The road has dropped into a snow covered mountain glen near a creek.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Ice and rime has formed on the slowly moving stream, and the small valley
is pristine, clear and cold.  You can see animal prints in the snow.  Large
animal prints.  Looks like wolf tracks, and a lot of them.  Those are very, 
very large animal prints.</LongDescription>
