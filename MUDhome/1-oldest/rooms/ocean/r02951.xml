  <Name>Hollow Log</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are inside a hollow log, perhaps twenty meters in length.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The west end of the log is the small end, and the entrance is overgrown
with heavy brush.  The eastern end is open, and a large garden can be
seen in that direction.  Small animals have made thier homes in here, and
your passage sends them scurrying toward the dark end of the log.</LongDescription>
