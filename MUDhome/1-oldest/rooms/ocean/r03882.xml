  <ShortDescription>You are on a small, stone landing looking over an ancient aquaduct.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A stone arch rises overhead, and several tunnels exit from the landing.
close below is a cold stream of water that enters via the old aquaduct.
Water condenses on the ceiling and drips down your back, making you shiver.
To the east you see some stairs leading up and down into the temple, but
great tumbled stones block any access to them.</LongDescription>
