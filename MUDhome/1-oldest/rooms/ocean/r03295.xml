  <ShortDescription>You stand outside a high walled garden, before a golden gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The garden draws you to it, you feel it beckoning you.  Its walls stand
about four meters high, covered with dense ivy all over, except at the gate
which is made of golden bars shaped into the the gate with the outline of
a rose in the center.  Not even the smallest humanoid could pry his way
through the bars, but there's no need, the gate looks open.</LongDescription>
