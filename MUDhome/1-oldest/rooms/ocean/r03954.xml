  <ShortDescription>You are on the portico outside Trantori's Summer Home.  Clouds surround you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Far below, over the edge, you can see smaller trees making up the Enchanted
Forest.  Looking east you see Khallazar's hut, suspended in a clearing.
There seems to be a misty valley on the other side of the city wall, and
occasionally great winged monsters of some sort drift through that mist.
An open door leads inside to a single, large room.</LongDescription>
