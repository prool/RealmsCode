  <ShortDescription>You are on East Hildor Lane, outside a famous fighting school.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The building on the south side of the lane doesn't look any more imposing
than the rest of the buildings in the neighborhood, and has a thatched roof
just as they do.  But a sign out front proclaims it to be Jerome's School
for Fighters.  Jerome no longer does the training, but leaves it to his
three sons to accomplish under his supervision.</LongDescription>
