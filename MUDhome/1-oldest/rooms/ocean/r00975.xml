  <Name>The Widow Maker - Crew's Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the large crew quarters of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large quarters extends to the south, covering most of the port side
of the ship.  There are at least two dozen beds on each side of the room
housing nearly fifty pirates.  The stench down here is pretty unbearable,
but somehow these people manage to go months at sea with only the fish as
company.</LongDescription>
