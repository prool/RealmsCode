  <ShortDescription>Oooops!  This is one slippery slide!</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are traveling swiftly down a careening slide, and have come to a point
where you must reverse direction as you continue your downard journey.  This
slide is not nearly big enough to bring much equipment down it, but it sure
provides a fast attack for troops who must get from the castle above to the
road below in time of emergency.</LongDescription>
