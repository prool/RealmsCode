  <ShortDescription>You are in a shabby little emporium which sells a variety of goods.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Thoto the gnome opened this shop the day the room was completed when the
castle was built.  He has been in business here for a very long time, and
doesn't mind cheating you out of a month's pay.  No guarantees with anything
you purchase in here.</LongDescription>
