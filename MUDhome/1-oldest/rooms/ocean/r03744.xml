  <ShortDescription>You are in an arena draped with red banners.  You await your test.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Red Knight will try you in the eyes of God.  He has been chosen from
amongst several who volunteered from the order of red paladin knights who 
serve God in their fight against the evil that inhabits this land called
Mordor.  If you are ready, and God has chosen you, you will defeat the
Red Knight no matter how hard he tries.  He knows that, and wishes you
the best of luck, but he will fight his hardest.</LongDescription>
