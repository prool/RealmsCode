  <Name>Ashton River Bridge</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The bridge is a part of Lelion Way running east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly to the east is the intersection of Lelion Way and Riverdell
Way.  Below is the Ashton River, which runs north/south at this part
of its course.  A sign on the bridge says to beware of trolls who
have been known to accost travelers at this point of their journey.
In the South you can see the Ashton Waterfalls, a spectacular sight
visited by locals and tourists alike.</LongDescription>
