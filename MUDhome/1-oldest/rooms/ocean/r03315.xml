  <ShortDescription>The path splits to the southeast and southwest, around the fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It wasn't this cold when you entered the gate, but a suddenly you are
aware of a chill breeze and light mist that has settled on you.  This
place is very quiet.  There are no birds nor crickets, and all you can
hear is the soft sound of your boots on the gravel.  In the distance to
the south there is also a sound of gentle splashing from the fountain
you see there.</LongDescription>
