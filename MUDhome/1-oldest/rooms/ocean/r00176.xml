  <ShortDescription>You are in the dusty library of the Vickers household.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Bookshelves extend from floor to ceiling on three walls of the room.  The
windows on the fourth wall are so covered with dust that you cannot see out.
A large wooden desk, covered with a sheet, and a leather couch are the only
furniture.  It looks as though someone has been searching here.  You see
books scattered on the floor.</LongDescription>
