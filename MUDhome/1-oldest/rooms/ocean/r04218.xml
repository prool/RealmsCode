  <ShortDescription>This is the southeast area of the Tower Castle of Prince Rutger.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is an intersection with Apstone Tunnel farther to the north, while to
the south you see a line of shops which serve the needs of the castle's
inhabitants.  Not far from here is a pawn shop, usually frequented by some
of the younger and less well paid members of the castle's defense force.</LongDescription>
