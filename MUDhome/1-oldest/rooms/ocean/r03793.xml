  <ShortDescription>You are on the southern beach of Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You stand at the southern tip of the beach area, looking over the Nylandian
Bay.  There are several large merchant ships moored together near the ship-
masters pier, and in the distance you see the dock used by the dreaded
Widow Maker.  From here you also see the Marine Commandant's offices and
Marine barracks.  Oceancrest suffered from attacks from sea for many years
until the marines were trained by some of the city's great heroes.  A good
distance from here to the west you see some beach caves and grottos.</LongDescription>
