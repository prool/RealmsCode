  <ShortDescription>You have come to a desolate corner in the equally desolate hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The corner of the hallway is just as unremarkable as the rest of the 
hallways you have seen; however, you feel the presense of some evil force
at work here.  Or maybe it's just the evil assassins in your party planning
to backstab one of you for your weapon.</LongDescription>
