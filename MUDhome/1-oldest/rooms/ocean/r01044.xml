  <Name>Oceanview/Eidenhoft/Nagaritha Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the rather busy intersection of Oceanview Drive, Nagaritha
Drive and Eidenhoft Boulevard.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Eidenhoft Boulevard runs awkwardly from northeast to southwest.  The
road eventually turns northward and ends up at Lithium Inlet.  Oceanview
Drive is a scenic alternative to the always busy and crowded Main Street.
It runs parallel to Main Street for almost its entire distance.  Nagaritha
Drive runs east to west and borders both the large estates and the vast
farmlands in the east.</LongDescription>
