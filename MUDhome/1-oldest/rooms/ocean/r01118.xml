  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Marina Way, just west of the Oceancrest Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Central Arena is notorious for its lack of compassion when
it comes to duels and brawls.  Most contestants join to have the chance
to fight with some of the great gladiators of all time, but also end up
dying soon thereafter.  The Arena offers many levels of difficulty from
sheer brute strength to wisdom and skill in outmanuvering your opponent.
it is definately not for the weak of heart.  The Arena entrance is 
located to the north.</LongDescription>
