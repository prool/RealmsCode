  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, just east of Hafnia Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small road called Hafnia Way intersects Waterfront Way to the west.  
The large Corn Fields are starting to wind down, leading into the more 
commercial areas of town to the west.  On the south are the Visitor's
Stables, where horses may be left in comfort while you travel through
town.  It is not always wise to have horses wondering through town, as it
is both a risk to the people and to the horses.</LongDescription>
