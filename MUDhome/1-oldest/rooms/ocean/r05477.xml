  <ShortDescription>You are at the bottom of a wild slide which starts at the castle gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The slide is so slick that you cannot possibly go up, but there is always
the road.  This place provides you with a good place to stay out of the
the rain and snow, however.  You can see the east side of the guard barracks
from here.</LongDescription>
