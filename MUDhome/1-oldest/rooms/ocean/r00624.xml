  <ShortDescription>You are on Avatar Boulevard, between the Bushman Estate and the Plantation.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Plantation to the west grows a number of precious commodities that 
Oceancrest uses to trade with other cities who are not so fortunate.
Luckily, there is not much the City of Oceancrest needs in addition to
what is already farmed within the city.  However, it is always nice to
get in some good elven bows or strong dwarven armors.</LongDescription>
