  <ShortDescription>The grey hallway ends abruptly at the shore of a large, undergound lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The grime covered grey walls seem to disappear into the lake as you 
head off to the north.  You can hear sounds of fighting and arguing to the
south.  The lake to the north does not look very friendly.  You can 
occasionally see some air bubbles rising to the surface, a sure sign
of some sort of life form down there.</LongDescription>
