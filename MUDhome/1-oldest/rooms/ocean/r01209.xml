  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Nagaritha Drive and Regalia Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Regalia Way, not to be confused with Regalia Drive, is a small connector
road, which cuts through the Regalia Convent towards the Allisk Circle.
Regalia Way is not a very popular road, but it is a short cut out of
the corn and wheat fields in the southern section of town.  The large
corn fields are located on the southern side of the road, protected by
a mesh wire fence.</LongDescription>
