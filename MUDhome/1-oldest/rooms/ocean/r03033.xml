  <LongDescription>Except for the torches and lanterns you might be carrying there is no
source of light in this part of the passage.  Your footsteps echo from
the cold stone floor, and a trickle of water runs down the center of the
passsageway.  Further north you can hear mechanical noises and garbled
shouts in what sounds like a foreign tongue.</LongDescription>
