  <Name>Fresh Water Pool</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are standing at the edge of a cool and placid pool of fresh water.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The water looks dark and deep, and hardly a ripple can be seen.  As you
look across it, you see one spot where a bubble forms every few minutes
and pops at the surface.  Its the only thing disturbing the otherwise
quiet pool.  Trees form a canopy over the surface, and a path runs around
edge of the water.  Not far from here you see the top of a small brick
structure.</LongDescription>
