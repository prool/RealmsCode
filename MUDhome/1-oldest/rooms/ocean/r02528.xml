  <ShortDescription>You are on Annetol Way, south of a grassy hill and the amphitheater.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side of the road you see an asbestos covered wall made of lava
rock.  The wall feels very warm to the touch.  Looks like the road comes
to an end a little farther east, where you see a very bright light.</LongDescription>
