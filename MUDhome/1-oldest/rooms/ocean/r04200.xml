  <ShortDescription>You are inside Prince Rutger's Castle, next to the massive gates.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This huge castle is built almost vertically, to best utilize the mountain
side it is constructed on.  The lower level is used for troop assembly and
social events, such as exhibitions and contests.  The massive gates are
always closed at night, but gate guards are always here on duty.  The guard 
station is located to the south.  On the north side is an information 
office.  The main courtyard is to the east.</LongDescription>
