  <ShortDescription>You are in the Challenger's Ready Room, preparing for battle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>All players must enter the Challenger's Ready Room before they can enter
the main combat arenas.  The large sporting facility supports a number of
lower-level arenas where small groups of low level gladiators can challenge
single monsters.  There are three main arenas:  The first is a low-level
arena where less-experienced players may challenge a large gladiator.
The other two are one-on-one arenas where you may challenge single 
gladiators in hand-to-hand, mortal combat.</LongDescription>
