  <ShortDescription>This is the rain swept valley where the village of Timarask once stood.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are on Lyanden Road in Timarask Valley, where it rains constantly.
The rain never lets up in this valley, but occasionally it is less violent
than other times.  A fierce wind whips down from the majestic and dark Mount
Aphinix, driving the rain before it.  At times you cannot see your hand 
before your face, and the rain stings your eyes.</LongDescription>
