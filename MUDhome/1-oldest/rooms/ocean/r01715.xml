  <ShortDescription>You are on Melbourne Avenue between a number of small shops beside the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large building on the west side of the road.  To the south is
the Medical Supplies shop and to the north is the Leather Armory.  This
being the poorer part of town, most of the armor sold there is relatively
inexpensive.  On the east side of the road are a number of small buildings.
Directly to the east is Ian's Fletchery, where bows are made and repaired.</LongDescription>
