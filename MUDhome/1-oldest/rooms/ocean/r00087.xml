  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road and Main Street cross in a T-intersection here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street is the major north-south street, while Plasnelt Road runs
across the village in an east-west direction.  On the southeast corner
there is a large stable and several barns.  Merchants often sponsor
expeditions to the Kista Forest, and pack animals are needed to make
up a caravan.  There is a thriving trade with the gnomish craftsmen who
live in the forest.</LongDescription>
