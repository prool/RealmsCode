  <Name>Over the Dennanl Abyss</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are flying across the deadly abyss which stretches infinitely below you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The sight of the vertigo directly below you almost makes you nauseous
as the abyss seems to spiral downward into nothingness.  Hopefully your
magical spells will last long enough to get you across this cavern.
You wouldn't want to meet whatever is down there going freefall.</LongDescription>
