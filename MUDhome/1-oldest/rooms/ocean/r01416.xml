  <ShortDescription>You are in a small room containing bookshelves of books.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small library is used by many visitors and other mages to better
their basic mage skills.  Scanning through the books, there's nothing
of real value that you haven't seen before.  Looks like a place where
many apprentices go to study.</LongDescription>
