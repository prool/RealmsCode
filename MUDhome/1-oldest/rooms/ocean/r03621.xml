  <ShortDescription>You are at the garden entrance of the main courtyard in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The garden lies further to the west through a small gate set in a fence.
A great stone turret stands at the corner of the courtyard here, and a
stairwell winds around the outside of it, seemingly going forever, since
it disappears into the mist above.  The courtyard continues to the north,
south and east from here.</LongDescription>
