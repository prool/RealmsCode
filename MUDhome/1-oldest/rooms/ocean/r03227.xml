  <Name>Bridge Over The Bay</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are passing over the immense Nylandian Bay on a long wooden bridge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From here you can see far out to sea.  Pirate ships often lie in wait 
just outside the bay, waiting to ambush foreign merchant ships as they 
approach the city anchorage.  Be assured though, that the city is well 
fortified.</LongDescription>
