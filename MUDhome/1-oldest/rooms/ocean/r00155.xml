  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Plasnelt Road and East Ulandia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Plasnelt Road continues east and west, while East Ulandia meanders along
the banks of the Baldywyne River.  To the west you can see the South Bridge,
which crosses over to the west part of the village.  The bridge is safe
enough during the day, but many bad things have been reported about it at
night.  Some say there is a monster that lives under it who sleeps by day.</LongDescription>
