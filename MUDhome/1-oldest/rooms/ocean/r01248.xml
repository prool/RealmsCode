  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lankshire Parkway, north of Nagaritha Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lankshire Parkway intersects Nagaritha Drive to the south.  On the east
side of the road, you can see the large Slaughterhouse facility and the
various preservation and packaging routines.  The large center provides
much of the beef the city needs to survive.  Luckily, Oceancrest is very
self-sufficent, and relies little on outside sources for day-to-day needs.</LongDescription>
