  <ShortDescription>You are in the southern part of the side alley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You would have missed the entrance to this if you were not such a careful 
observer.  This area appears to be very well traveled.  There seems to be 
a lot of footprints leading north.  Maybe it's just a short cut.</LongDescription>
