  <ShortDescription>You are in a small tree stuck somewhere inside the Riverdell Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Being able to track is essential for any ranger.  Your ability to track
this far shows that you are ready to advance to the next level.  If this
is your goal, go to the tree branch.  If you wish to leave the park, go
out.  If you wish to continue in the park, you must look for more tracks.</LongDescription>
