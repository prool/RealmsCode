  <ShortDescription>You are on Tower Lane between Charybdis Avenue and Commerce Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A very large and tall hotel is on both sides of the street, and if you look
overhead you can see a walkway bridge which spans Tower Lane.   The narrow
bridge seems to connect both buildings together, and you see people up
there looking down on the street.  A sign on the bridge proclaims it to
be the Royal Kista Arms.  The Milsene Museum is east of here.</LongDescription>
