  <Name>Cathedral of Worldly Bliss</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a gothic cathedral with stained glass windows.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive walls of the cathedrals seem to extend to the heavens,
As you gaze at the structure, you wonder how human hands alone could
have built something of such splendor and magnificence.  The faint
echo of a female voice delivering sermon reverberates throughout,
as if calling out the very essence of your soul.</LongDescription>
