  <ShortDescription>You are on top of the Tree of Life, overlooking all of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Tree of Life is symbolically one of the most interesting phemonena
in Oceancrest.  From here, you can see the splendor of the city of 
Oceancrest.  The Tree of Life provides much of the life-giving energy
you can see and sense throughout the land.  It has always been a mystery
to everyone, but no one seems to argue it.  You may start your quest in
the Land of Mordor by heading down the tree.</LongDescription>
