  <ShortDescription>You are in a blood-filled room known as the Gladiator Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The coarse sand beneath your feet absorbs the blood of past victims of
both the gladiators and the participants (mostly the latter).  The
gladiators are ruthless fighters who will waste no time in attacking
you when you least expect it.  There are a number of different levels
of gladiators, but most of them look the same.  To the west is the
Monster's Feeding Grounds, where combatants fight non-humanoid monsters
who are hungry for dinner.</LongDescription>
