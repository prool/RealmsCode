  <ShortDescription>You are in a very close section of a broken wall in the Uland Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You really can't go anywhere from here, except back to the passage.  There
is a small hole in the floor, but the only way you could possibly go down it
would be if you removed everything you are wearing.  It's a very small 
opening, and it looks like you probably could not come back up.</LongDescription>
