  <ShortDescription>You are at the base of the Lyanden Lighthouse, and see no apparent entry.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>An intense magical light comes from the top of the tower about twelve
meters overhead, almost blindingly bright even in the daytime.  The base
of the tower is smooth and seamless, with no apparent entry.  The tower
also appears to be larger at the top than at the base, like it was
inverted.  The surface is almost slick, and provides no handholds,
making it impossible to climb.  (But why would you want to?)</LongDescription>
