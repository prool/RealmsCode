  <ShortDescription>To the north is Saint Anne's Retreat, and an old graveyard.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The retreat looks a little like a small castle, with twin towers at either
end, and a rampart in between.  You can see movement at the windows, and 
there is a good woodsmoke coming from a chimney.  The great door is closed
but even from here you can see there is a bell tower where a visitor might 
ring for admittance.</LongDescription>
