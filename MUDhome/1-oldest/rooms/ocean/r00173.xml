  <ShortDescription>Phexton Road South continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The great, brown wall on the south side of the road is much higher here
than most of the wall.  Strange that the builders would deliberately make
this section so much different from the rest of the uniform wall.  A series
of steps will take you to the top, if you desire to go that way.  There
used to be a village law about citizens climbing up there, but then the
elders decided there was no harm in it, so feel free to climb if you desire.</LongDescription>
