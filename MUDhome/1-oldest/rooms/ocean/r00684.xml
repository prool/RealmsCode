  <ShortDescription>You are on Darmanian Way, between the Darmanain Memorial and the Stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Stables are located on the north side of the road, and
provide visitors with a safe and inexpensive place to leave their horses
while visiting in town.  Although horses and other steeds are not illegal
in Oceancrest, for the safety of both the animal and citizens, they should
be left in the stables while in town.</LongDescription>
