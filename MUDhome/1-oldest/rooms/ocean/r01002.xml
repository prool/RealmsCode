  <ShortDescription>You are on the east side of the circular path around the fountain.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The fountain to the west is a combination of modern and classical artwork
bringing together very lifelike statues with abstract backgrounds.  The
fountain is very large and you can occasionally see people with their feet
in it.  To the east is Regalia Drive, which takes you directly to the
Regalia Convent.  The circular path continues to the northwest and 
southwest.</LongDescription>
