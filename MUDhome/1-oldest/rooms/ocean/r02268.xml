  <ShortDescription>You have entered the Academy of Fighting Arts, where aspiring Fighters
go during their early years to train in the intelligent art of fighting.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Fighting is not all brute strength, and a good fighter must realize this.
In order to advance in levels as a fighter, you must first defeat an
equally capable fighter one level higher than you.  If you are a veteran
aspiring to advance to second class, you should enter the red door.  If
you are already a Veteran, second class, you should enter the blue door.</LongDescription>
