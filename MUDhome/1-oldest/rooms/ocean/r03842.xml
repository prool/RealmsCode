  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on the main highway north of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Of all the roads converging on Oceancrest, this may be the safest.  That's  
not to say the highway has no danger, but fewer crimes are reported along
here.  There is a guard patrol, but its only during the day.  The guards
tend to think that anyone dumb enough to be out here at night deserves what
they get.  In the distance to the north you see snow covered mountains.</LongDescription>
