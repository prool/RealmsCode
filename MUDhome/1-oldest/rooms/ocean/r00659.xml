  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Amberton Lane, west of the elven shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Elven Shrine of Corellon Larethian lies on the east side of the road
as a religious reminder to all elves.  The elven race is the most pre-
dominant race on the land, but they tend to keep to themselves.  Oceancrest
is primarily a human settlement, but once outside of Oceancrest, elves
vastly outnumber humans.</LongDescription>
