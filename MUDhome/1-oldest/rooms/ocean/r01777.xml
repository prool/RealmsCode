  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Netherworld Lane, south of a large housing complex.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Housing is usually not a problem in Oceancrest as long as you don't mind
living in one of the two large housing complexes.  There is no room for
individual houses within the borders of Oceancrest, so many people build
houses outside of the city.  However, most feel more secure living inside
the City Walls and have learned to survive, in relative comfort, in these
housing complexes.</LongDescription>
