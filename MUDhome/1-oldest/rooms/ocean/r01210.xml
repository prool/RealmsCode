  <LongDescription>The rolling corn fields on the south side of the road provide food for
most of the residents of Oceancrest.  Mr. DeNail owns and operates the
large complex, and is always willing to hire on some unskilled labor 
to work the fields and scare off the crows and other pests that plague
the corn fields.</LongDescription>
