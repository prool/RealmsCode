  <ShortDescription>You are at the edge of a grassy meadows surrounded by old oaks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A particularly large old oak stands here at the meadow's edge, slightly
apart from the others.  A ladder is set against its base, and high in the
tree there is a ramshackle little wooden platform.  It's hard to tell
exactly what's up there, but something colorful flutters occasionally
at the perimeter.</LongDescription>
