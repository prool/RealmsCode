  <ShortDescription>You are inside the gate of the Necropolis.  Shivers runs down your spine..</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path you are on leads north and south, and is paved with simple crushed
gravel.  On both sides to the east and west you see a well kept cemetery
with plain tombstones imbedded in the cold earth.  An eerie mist is curling
around you as walk on the path, a mist that is not visible from outside the
gate.  Perhaps you are imagining it, but perhaps the residents of the
necropolis don't like sunny days or visitors.</LongDescription>
