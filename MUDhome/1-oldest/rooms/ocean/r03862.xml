  <Name>Steamy Jungle Trail</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on a hot and steamy path leading east and west through the jungle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Heavy vines hang from the trees and monkeys chatter overhead, watching
you as you travel along the poorly defined path.  A family of ettercaps
has been reported to live on this section of the island, but you haven't
seen any evidence of that yet.  It's surprising how quiet the jungle
can be, and then suddenly it erupts with noise.  When the monkeys stop
their chattering it may be a bad sign that something dangerous is nearby.</LongDescription>
