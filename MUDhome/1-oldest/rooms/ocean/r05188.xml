  <ShortDescription>You are atop a copper dragon on a grassy knoll.  East is Galgorie Pond.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is often the resting place for riders of the copper dragons.  From
here, you are within walking distance of Prince Ragnar's castle.  This spot
is also a favorite for the dragons too, as they like to roll in the grass
and wildflowers.  There is a quiet pond to the east, and a wooded copse
to the south.  A copper dragon waits for your command.</LongDescription>
