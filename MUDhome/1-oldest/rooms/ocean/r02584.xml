  <Name>Weeping Willows</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the bank of a small stream flowing through a copse of Willows. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>this is the eastern side of the Hanging Gardens, between the rose garden
and the fruit orchid.  Many say there is magic associated with the trees
you find here, and some even say the willows truly weep for the sins of
men.  Occasionally you see sprites flit from tree to tree.  Mostly they
ignore you, but some stop and stare from a distance.  The second level
is located up the path to the west.</LongDescription>
