  <ShortDescription>You are in a hot, stuffy greenhouse at the north end of the palace.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The greenhouse houses a number of exotic and unusual plants.  Little
did you know, they were man-eating.  A couple of them snap at you
as you walk in but most are firmly rooted.  Some, however, seem to
be moving towards you.</LongDescription>
