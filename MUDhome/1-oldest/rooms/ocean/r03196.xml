  <ShortDescription>You are at the southern end of a secluded pirate bay.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The water at this end of the bay is more shallow than the rest of the
bay, and is quite clear.  Tropical fish dart between your legs, and you
can see a number of larger fish near the bottom.  Looking down, you can
make out the outlines of a number of things buried in the sea bed below.
Curious.  Could this be the spot where Morgan's ship went down?</LongDescription>
