  <ShortDescription>You are walking beneath giant redwood trees in the enchanted forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trees are the biggest you have ever seen, and disappear into the
clouds above.  The lowest branches are far overhead and form a canopy,
filtering the sunlight during the day.  Not far to the southwest you can
see a rope bridge across a narrow chasm, and to the north are what appear
to be even bigger redwood trees.</LongDescription>
