  <ShortDescription>You are at a cross roads in the jungle, near a rusty cemetery gate.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gate hangs at an odd angle, and looks as though the next strong breeze
will knock it down completely.  The cemetery behind the overgrown fence
has not had any care in a long time.  The road here continues to the east
and the west.  The smell of salt air comes from the east, and it sounds
like surf in that direction.</LongDescription>
