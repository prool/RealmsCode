  <ShortDescription>You are walking between two forests cut out by Neilian Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The dense forests on both sides of the road do not appear as omnimous as
they had originally appeared from Leviathan or Riverdell.  Nevertheless,
the forests seem rather spooky.  Sometimes you might be able to find 
tracks into the forests if you look very carefully.</LongDescription>
