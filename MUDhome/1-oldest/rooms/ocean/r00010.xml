  <ShortDescription>This is the intersection of Goldenrod Avenue and Wall Road West.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have reached the northwest corner of the village of Brownhaven.
A guard's tower is set in the corner of the wall, and you can see a
stairwell just inside the wall which appears to provide access to the
station up there.  The Brownhaven militia isn't very large, but they
have recruited the meanest and toughest citizens they could find.  The
guards at this post seem to be typical of the Brownhaven force.</LongDescription>
