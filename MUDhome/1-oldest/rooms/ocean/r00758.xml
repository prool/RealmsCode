  <LongDescription>These magnificent circles scattered throughout Oceancrest display the
proud heritage of the city.  The Oceancrest Circle welcomes all visitors
to Oceancrest.  Visitors to Oceancrest are warned that some of the less
desirable elements of any city are likely to be found in the northeastern
quadrant of the town, and are therefore advised to avoid the area.</LongDescription>
