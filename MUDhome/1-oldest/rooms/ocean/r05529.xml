  <ShortDescription>You are at the base of Gorgon's Tower.  Gorgon, a blind demon, lives inside.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Gorgan took this tower as his own almost 300 years ago, and was the terror
of the countryside until he accidently got acid in his many eyes.  He
consulted the herbilist who lived on the farm down the trail, but she saw
through his disguise and made his blindness permanent.  As his last act of
terror, he burned the farm and turned the daughter into an ugly toad.</LongDescription>
