  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, east of a dense, thick forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The forest on the west side of the road is protected by the thick trees
and shrubs growing around its perimiter, preventing anyone from actually
entering the forest, save for a couple of rangers who happen to be 
searching for tracks.  Riverdell continues to the north and south.</LongDescription>
