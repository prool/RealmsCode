  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, just west of the Dentra Archery Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dentra Central Archery Range is one of the finest ranges in Oceancrest,
not to mention the world.  The Range is divided into two sections for 
optimal usage.  As many of the archer enjoy wagering on shots, the eastern
section of the Range is used primarily by the marksman archers.  The
western section of the Range may be used by walk-ons and other, less able
archers that just want some practice.</LongDescription>
