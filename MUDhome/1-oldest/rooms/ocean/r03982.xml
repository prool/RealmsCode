  <ShortDescription>You are inside a hollow shaft in a giant redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are clinging to ladder rungs nailed to the inside of this great tree.
You can go up or down, but it would be silly to stop here.  It's dark and
silent all around you.  Think of it this way:  where you go, you won't be
here, and that's better, don't you think?</LongDescription>
