  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on Marina Way, just west of the Oceancrest Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Oceancrest Central Arena is located to the east.  You can hear loud
shouts of encouragement from inside the thick stone walls.  Unfortunately,
you don't know if the cheers are for the competitors or the gladiators.
The entrance to the Arena is located to the south.  It is advised that
you visit the Arena Events and Information Center off of Main Street and
Overland Drive before visiting the Arena itself.  </LongDescription>
