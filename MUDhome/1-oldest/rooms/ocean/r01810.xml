  <ShortDescription>You have entered the mysterious Mage's Sanctuary called the Wizard's Eye.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the Wizard's Eye, where souls are kept in fine gems.  Any and all
who seek to learn the arts of necromancy and magic must come here to train
and advance in level.  Neophytes up to level two should go through the 
silver arch.  If you seek a level from four to nine, you may enter the ruby
encrusted door.  Those powerful mages who hope to advance to level ten and
above must fly to the diamond and gold balcony. </LongDescription>
