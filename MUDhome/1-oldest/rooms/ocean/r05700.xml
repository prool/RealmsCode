  <LongDescription>The small village of Phexton is further north, and Phexton Bridge is south.
Long ago, before modern signaling methods, there were a series of watch
towers built throughout the mountains whose purpose was to watch for trolls
and other invaders and warn the cities.  They used to light giant bonfires
on top of the towers to signal one another.  They are no longer used for
that purpose, and stand empty these days.</LongDescription>
