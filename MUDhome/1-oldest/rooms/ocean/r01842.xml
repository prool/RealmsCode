  <Name>The Southern Path Junction</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the junction of the center path and the south ofern path.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Center Path, naturally, runs through the center of the Barbarian 
Pits.  The Southern Path runs along the southern border of the Pits. 
The barbarian race isn't all that bright and do not have a lot of fancy 
names for their roads, especially since they're just dirt paths.  The
primative training facility for the tribesmen is located to the south
here.  The barbarians are known to test their own before allowing them
to advance to higher levels.</LongDescription>
