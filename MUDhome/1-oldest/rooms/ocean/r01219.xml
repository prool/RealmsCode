  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, just north of Thackery's Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Thackery's Pub is a run-down little family pub catering mostly to the
farm workers who live in the area.  The wine is particularly good,
however, since they buy it from the Chateau Richland Winery across the
way to the north.  You hear ribald singing coming from the door.</LongDescription>
