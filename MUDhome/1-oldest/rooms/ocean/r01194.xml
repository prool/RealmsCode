  <ShortDescription>Amberton Lane continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Amberton Lane intersects Kafkan Way to the south, where the street
abrubtly ends.  You can see the large palace on top of an almost
artificial looking mountain.  The eerie palace overlooks the Necropolis.
On the east side of the road, there is a large shopping complex which
appears to specialize in various types of weaponry.  There are no
entrances on this side of the road, but you can probably get into
the center from Kafkan Way.</LongDescription>
