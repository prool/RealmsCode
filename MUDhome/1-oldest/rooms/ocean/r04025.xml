  <Name>Mountain Stream</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You see a narrow stream of crystal clear ice water running across the path.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>If you listen closely, it seems the stream murmurs in a language you can
almost understand.  The path twists and turns as it traverses the mountain,
making it difficult to see very far in either direction.  This might be a 
good place to rest.  There is a shallow cave where the stream issues.</LongDescription>
