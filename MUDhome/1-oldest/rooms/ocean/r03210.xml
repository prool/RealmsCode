  <ShortDescription>You are on the western stretch of Lake View Road, north of the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the top of a wide valley, protected from the elements by high
mountain ranges.  The city of Kista is to the south and Lake Kista is to
the east of you.  You have heard that the lake has purifying powers, but
not everyone believes it.  The runoff from the lake provides the drinking
water to the city below, and the entire city enjoys good health, if that
is any indication of the water's ability.</LongDescription>
