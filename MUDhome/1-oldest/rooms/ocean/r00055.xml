  <ShortDescription>This is the end of a small alley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north is Brownhaven Town Square, to the west is the back entrance
to an inn, and to the east is a back entrance to a shoppe.   There's quite a
bit of noise coming from the pub.  Either they're having a good time, or 
a very bad time in there.  You hear a lot of yelling and cheering on the
other side of the south wall.</LongDescription>
