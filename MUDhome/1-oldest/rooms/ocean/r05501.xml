  <ShortDescription>You are south of Hafnia Central park on Rue Caledonia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south is the circle road which travels all the way around the city.
On the west side of the street is a large lot covered with tents and
a lot of people.  Looks like another caravan is getting ready to leave
the city.  A lot of stuff comes here from Oceancrest, but Hafnia also
exports some very finely made elven crafts, such as archery tackle.</LongDescription>
