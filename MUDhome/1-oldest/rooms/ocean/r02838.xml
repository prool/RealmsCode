  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern shore of the large, underground Lake Plasnelt.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The lake is a very dangerous place to be wandering around because there
really isn't anyplace to run.  Dangerous sahuagin have been said to roam
the surface and depths of salt water lakes and oceans.  The center of
the lake appears to also be the center of activity.</LongDescription>
