  <Name>Forest Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a glass-walled tunnel deep under the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walls are smooth and slippery, and they glow with a greenish hue.
The tunnel is as straight as if it had been laid out with a surveyor's line.
It continues in both directions, but even with the greenish glow, it is too
dark to see what might be in either direction.</LongDescription>
