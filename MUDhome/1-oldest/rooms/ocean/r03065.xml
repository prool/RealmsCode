  <Name>Goblin Library</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have found what might be called the goblin priest's library.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Several goblins ignore your presense and continue to work, while others
rise to object.  You never imagined goblins could read or write, let alone
have a library.  Along the back wall are several shelves filled with both
large and small books, many old scrolls and a few hefty and ancient tomes.
A few wooden tables and chairs run the length of the room.  Scattered atop
the tables are piles of parchment, open books and writing instruments.
Closer examination of the titles reveals that some of the books are written
about magic and mages.  They may contain the incantations and words for
great spells, or perhaps directions to lost treasure.  Too bad you don't
read goblin.  You also notice some of the books appear to be in elvin.</LongDescription>
