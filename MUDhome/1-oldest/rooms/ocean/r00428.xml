  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Bendine Way, west of the Kimber Family Locksmith.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Kimber Family has, for many generations, provided custom locks and 
bolts for nearly everyone who has ever wanted to keep something protected.
Furthermore, they're likely to be able to open up any known lock.  On the
west side of the road is the Adlermann Center of Marine Research and
Oceanography, bordering the Rhinestone Marina.</LongDescription>
