  <Name>Dwarven Dignitary's Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in Drowlin's quaters, the dwarven dignitary from Tragular.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Drowlin spends time traveling between Tragular and Kista so he's not
always in town.  He usually shows up every two or three days depending
on the condition of the roads.  Tragular is a large dwarven city deep
within the mountains to the south.  The quarters are rather nicely 
decorated with lots of gold and metals around, displaying some artifacts
of Drowlin's heritage.</LongDescription>
