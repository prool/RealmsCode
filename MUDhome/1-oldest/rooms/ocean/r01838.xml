  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the southern path around the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Southern Path brings you around towards the low-level training 
grounds, located to the west.  In order to advance as a barbarian, you
must prove yourself to the barbarian leaders by defeating another who
is one level greater than you.  Only then will you be allowed to advance
to the next level.  The path circles back toward the entrance to the
north and heads towards the southern border to the south.</LongDescription>
