  <ShortDescription>You are in a magnificient ballroom located in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Huge oil paintings of the Lyanden line of royalty are around the room,
and each is draped in beautiful royal purple velvet.  The ballroom is
well lighted from glittering golden candlebras and crystal lamps.  At one
end of the room is a small chamber orchestra, led by a tall, thin man
with a great mane of hair.  he appears to be almost human.   Dancers
swirl around the room, and small groups stand at the side, laughing and
talking.  Are they laughing at you?  You do appear out of place in here.</LongDescription>
