  <ShortDescription>A small creek flows along the north side of the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Snow covers everything you see, and a flurry of snow is driven by the east
wind coming down from the mountain peaks.  Northwest of here, off the road,
there is a woodsman's hut.  Because of the wind, you can't tell where that
howling noise is coming from.</LongDescription>
