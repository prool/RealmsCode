  <ShortDescription>You are on the eastern side of the circle drive around Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>People whisper that there is a thieve's guild in one of the alleys near here.
It might be true, since the city patrol has picked up a number of inept
pickpockets in this area who appeared to be practicing.  They say the guild
runs a school for pickpockets, and a more advanced school for burglers.</LongDescription>
