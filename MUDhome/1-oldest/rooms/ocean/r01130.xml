  <ShortDescription>You are on a small stretch of Rosecrest Street between Marina and Main.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rosecrest is probably the longest street in Oceancrest and one of the few
streets that changes directions.  It starts in the south at the Southwest
Oceancrest Observational Station and runs north beside the west City Wall,
turns east and west along the south side of Nylandian Bay, then continues
north and south again to eventually go past the Lyanden Castle before ending
at the northern City Wall.  Right now, you are between Marina Way and Main 
Street.  Most building entrances are on Main Street.</LongDescription>
