  <ShortDescription>You are in an underground aquaduct which supplies fresh water to the temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel is dark and damp, and a small stream of water flows down the
center of it.  The slope is downward toward the east.  As you stand here,
knee deep in water, you feel slithery things nudge your legs.  You can
go southeast or west from here.</LongDescription>
