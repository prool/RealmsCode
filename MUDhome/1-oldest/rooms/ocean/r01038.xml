  <LongDescription>Dillsdale Memorial Park is located to the west of Oceanview Drive.  This
large park is used by the officals of Oceancrest for parties, invitationals,
or just public gatherings.  Dillsdale can also be used for making public
announcements and other informative uses.  The park is opened to the 
public, and reservable for weddings and other religious activities so long
as it doesn't interfere with the lawn golf tournaments.</LongDescription>
