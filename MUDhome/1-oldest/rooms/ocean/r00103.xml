  <ShortDescription>Brownhaven Way is a quiet north-south street with a great many trees on it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The street is almost park-like in its setting, and the shops are set
with wide distances between them and grassy walkways.  To the west is
small white building where you can hear cries of relief.  Looking south,
you can see the southern section of the wall which surrounds the village.
There is a cemetery with an odd tree in it on the east side of the street.</LongDescription>
