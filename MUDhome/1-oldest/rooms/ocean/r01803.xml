  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Waterfront Way, north of the Dentra Archery Range.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large archery range is flanked by a number of small shops and centers
to benifit the archer and other warriors.  On the north side of the road,
you can see a small center dedicated towards archery and fletchery.  This
area is primarily run by the elves since they are the best archers and 
know how to make the best bows and arrows in the land.</LongDescription>
