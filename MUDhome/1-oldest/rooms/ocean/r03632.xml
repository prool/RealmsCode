  <ShortDescription>You are at the eastern entrance to a broad alley used as a jousting run.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wide alley runs to the east between the main building of Castle Ragnar
and the great storage rooms on the south.  Several squires are walking
giant war horses while a number of knights stand in groups, getting ready
to make a run down the jousting path.  On the west side is a thick hedge,
and further south there is a small arms practice area.  Directly north is
the preparation area and the eastern entrance to the main building.</LongDescription>
