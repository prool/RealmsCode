  <ShortDescription>You are in a small, subterranian sea chamber connected to a larger cave.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On a coral reef jutting from the center of the chamber is an altar,
constructed from a rainbow of different colored coral.  The center of
the altar is dark red, stained with what looks like blood.  From your
childhood, you recall the horrifying tales of the sadistic rituals of
the Sahuagin race of creatures said to inhabit the depths below the seas.
Beyond a high part of the small island of coral, where you cannot see,
the chanting seems to be getting louder.</LongDescription>
