  <ShortDescription>You are in Poor Alley, a place many people wish they would never see again.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There;s a surprisingly large number of peoplw in this dark and cold alley.
Many of them are going to a wine shop located down some stairs.  Next door
is a missionary.  A group of missionary musicians stand outside, playing in
a small band and loudly proclaiming that all sinners will go to hell and
be eaten by Fenris.  A fat lady in an ankle-length black dress bangs a
tambourine against her ample hip, and wildly rolls her eyes as she sings.</LongDescription>
