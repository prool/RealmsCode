  <ShortDescription>You are in a very small, deserted cemetery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>What looked like a vacant lot from the road turned out to be a small
cemetery.  It has been kept up quite well over the years, but still
looks like it's deserted.  You see no visitors at all.  You wonder
if any of the ghosts of these people will show up to haunt those
who killed them so many years ago.</LongDescription>
