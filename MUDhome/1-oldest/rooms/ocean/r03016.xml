  <ShortDescription>You are near the center of the lair of the goblins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To your immediate south is a downward slope which looks quite slippery.
Beyond that is a large room, which is too dark to see.  There is a smaller
room off to the east side of the slope.  Finally, rough cut passages
lead to the northwest and northeast.</LongDescription>
