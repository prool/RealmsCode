  <ShortDescription>You are in the elven weaponsmith's shoppe.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The elven weaponsmith carries only the very best quality weapons.  His
prices are a little high, but elven quality cannot be exceeded.  You
see a lot of magical and strange weapons adorned on the walls, but
(of course) these are not for sale.  If you are looking for a missile
weapon, try the bowyer on the south side of town.  All weapons sold here
have been enchanted by the resident mage.</LongDescription>
