  <ShortDescription>You are on the second floor of the Towers.  There is a plush carpet along
the center of the hallway which runs west from here.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway is fantastically designed with many gold ornaments and arches
throughout.  The long red carpet on the floor spans the entire hallway.  
On the north side, you can see a railing which surrounds a large opening in 
in the floor.  Apparently, you can watch the activities on the floor below.
That must be the throne room down there.</LongDescription>
