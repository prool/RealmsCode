  <Name>Melbourne Entertainment Arena - Challenger's Ready Room</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the entrance to the Melbourne Entertainment Arena, about to do
battle with crooks, criminals and other outcasts of society.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Ready Room does not seem to provide you with much of anything
to fight with.  They suggest visiting D'Tan's Armory across the street
and maybe a couple of weapons shops around town before entering the arena.
The arena is a dangerous place, and should be entered with caution. </LongDescription>
