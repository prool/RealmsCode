  <ShortDescription>You are swimming in Kista Lake, wishing you had something to keep you afloat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>From here in the middle of the lake, you can see all of the surrounding
mountains, and perhaps on a clear day you could see parts of Oceancrest
as you look down the valley towards the east.  The nearby mountain tops
are covered with snow, and you can see large bird-like creatures flying
about the peaks.  There's something odd about them, however, as they
appear to be too large to actually fly.</LongDescription>
