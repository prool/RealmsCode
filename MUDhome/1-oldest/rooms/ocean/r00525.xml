  <LongDescription>The Lelion Beach and Park is a small beach in the Nylandian Bay forming
half of the Lithium Inlet.  At the beach, you can watch the various cargo
ships entering and leaving the city, bringing with them a wealth of
investments, both material and spiritual.  Oceancrest's carnival and fair
usually sets up tents on the lot to the west.  Late spring is carnival time.</LongDescription>
