  <Name>The Dracolich's Lair</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You stand before a mountain of gold and jewels.  Atop the glittering pile
is a pile of bones which pull themselves together in a clacking sound.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have foolishly stumbled upon the dracolich's lair.  The treasure
which lies before you is beyond your wildest imagination, and even if
the dracolich were to let you carry any of it off, you wouldn't be able
to take more than a small fraction of the wealth which lies on the floor.
The dracolich is one of the most feared beings in existance.  It has 
almost no physical being left and must exist on pure magical power alone.
The wealth on the ground begs to be picked up, but beware the dracolich!</LongDescription>
