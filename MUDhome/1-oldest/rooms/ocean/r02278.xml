  <ShortDescription>You are in a pretty rowdy bar in the southeastern side of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Chug-A-Lug is a down right rowdy tavern where just about anything can
happen.  Anyone can come in for a drink and to talk about the local news
such as who is going to be fighting in the Melbourne Entertainment Arena
in the evening.  Gamblers and hookers abound in this sleezy bar, not to
mention drunks, vagrants and even a few sailors.</LongDescription>
