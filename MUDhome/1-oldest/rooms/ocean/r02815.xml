  <ShortDescription>You are in a secluded hallway running east and west under the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a small hallway which breaks off to the south from here, leading
into darkness.  To the east, all you can see is the pitch blackness of
the dark rock and granite which has never seen the bright light of the
sun shining through the ice.  </LongDescription>
