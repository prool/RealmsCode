  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, north of a large corn field.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The corn fields to the south supply the city of Oceancrest with all the
corn it needs for both human and animal survival.  The fields cover quite
a few acres, and are protected by a tall fence.  On the north there is
a barn and a new silo being constructed to supplement the current one,
which has already reached capacity.  Oceancrest likes to keep extra food
in storage in case of a prolonged attack from outside the city walls.</LongDescription>
