  <LongDescription>The large Oceancrest Necropolis lies on the east side of Lankshire Parkway,
surrounded by tall, metal bars preventing looters, grave robbers and other
lunatics from entering the facility.  The Main Entrance to the Necropolis
is located off of Netherworld Lane to the north.  On the west, you can
see the Khelleva Mansion, a powerful monument to the most powerful family
in Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
