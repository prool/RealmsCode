  <Name>The Illusionist's Lab</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You feel your own presence in a complete illusion.  Are you still alive?</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The illusion is so realistic that you can even touch it.  The lab is full
of mysterious objects from all over the world.  Some of them are 
priceless and exist only once in time and space.  Interesting that you
see Shishkin's painting on the imaginatory wall.  It represents a forest
in so realistic way, that you even hear birds's songs and smell clover,
as you approach it.  On the opposite wall you can spot a mirror.  You
were just going to see how ugly you are, when you are struck by it's
emptyness.  The mirror offers no reflection!</LongDescription>
