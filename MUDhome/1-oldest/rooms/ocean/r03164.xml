  <Name>Lost in the Respitial Sea</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are floating on the waves in a vast sea.  Land is nowhere in sight.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You have the sinking feeling (pardon the pun) that you have become lost in
the sea.  You are probably wondering if you will ever see the land again.
Wouldn't it be nice to be back in Oceancrest and telling lies to to your
buddies again?  (You just know they tell 'em to you.)</LongDescription>
