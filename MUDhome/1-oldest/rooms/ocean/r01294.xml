  <ShortDescription>You are wading in the rushing waters of Ashton creek.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the west is a stone cottage near the bank and in a cleared area,
and to the east are great boulders on the shore line.  To the north
the stream tumbles over a broad but shallow waterfall.  In the distance
to the north you can see a rope bridge traversing the stream where it
narrows and starts to run deep.</LongDescription>
