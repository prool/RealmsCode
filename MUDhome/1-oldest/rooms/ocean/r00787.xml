  <ShortDescription>You have entered a large, odd-shaped room that is slanted on the south-
west corner.  A giant alter sits directly in the center of the room.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you approach the alter, a large plume of smoke and fire rises to 
greet you.  In the flame, you can make out a human-like face that speaks
to you: "Go into the darkness and you will find light.  The Crystal Alcove
is an illusion to prevent the unworthy from finding the treasures of
the Alcove.  Only the most skilled will pass."  With that being said,
the flame retreats back into the alter.</LongDescription>
