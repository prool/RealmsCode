  <ShortDescription>You are in the sitting room of Yab the Illusionist.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Yab is the most powerful of all who have chosen to master the craft of
illusion.  Others before her time gained power and respect by learning to
make things appear differently than what they really are.  Yab taught
Trantori, the High Invoker, how to make the mice at Khallazar's to appear
as powerful three-headed snakes.  A pillar supports a sparkling amethest.
Is it an illusion, or is there nothing else here?</LongDescription>
