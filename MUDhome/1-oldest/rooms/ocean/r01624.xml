  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, north of a large Gazebo.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oddly enough, there's a large, white gazebo located more or less in the
middle of no where on the south of Hillcrest Drive.  It doesn't seem
to have a purpose there, but stands between Hillcrest and Regalia Way,
which runs southwest out of Allisk Circle.  Allisk Circle is located 
to the east of here, intersecting with Lankshire, Appleton, Regalia and
Hillcrest Roads.</LongDescription>
