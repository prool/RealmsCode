  <ShortDescription>You are on Lelion Way, between Leia's Repair Shop and the Hospital facility.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The most modern science goes into healing patients, but many things cannot
be overcome.  The Oceancrest Caretaking Facility for the Mortally Wounded
provides care for people who are beyond recovery.  The facility also acts
as a hospital, providing relief to many thousands of Oceancrestillians who
are constantly getting hurt somehow.  On the north side of the road is
Leia's Repair Shop.  The entrance to her shop is located off of Avatar
Boulevard.</LongDescription>
