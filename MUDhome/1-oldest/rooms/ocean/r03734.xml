  <ShortDescription>You are in a hallway behind the registration desk of the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You must not have seen the sign telling you to keep out.  There's a reason
for signs, you know.  This long hallway stops at the southern wall of the
inn, with only one doorway going to a storage room on the east.  The desk
is to the north.  The storage room has a new lock on it, and another but
bigger sign says, "KEEP OUT."  The desk clerk probably has the key, but
why do you insist on violating the rules?</LongDescription>
