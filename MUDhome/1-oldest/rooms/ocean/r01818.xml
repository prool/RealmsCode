  <ShortDescription>You are in a small postal facility where you can send mail to others.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One of the great benifits of living in a large city like Oceancrest is
that you can get mail to people on the other side of town without having
to travel all the way over there.  Post Offices are scattered throughout
the land for this purpose.  You can even send mail to other cities as
well.  </LongDescription>
