  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, west of the Oceancrest Ministry of Knowledge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Rosecrest runs from north to south at this point in the city, and passes by
the famous Oceancrest Ministry of Knowledge.  Although not quite the same as
the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Knowledge is much more interested in
preserving documents and records then it is in arguing about the meaning of
life or the purpose of the universe.  The Ministry is very secretive, and
access is restricted to only the few who know the correct protocol.</LongDescription>
