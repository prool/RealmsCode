  <Name>Cross Hallway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a cross hallway upstairs in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly to the east is the main second floor hallway.  The cross hallway
is much narrower and runs north and south in the inn.  The carpet is a
little more worn and not as expensive as that in the main hallway, and the
lighting is not quite as bright.  Shadows covers some of the doorways,
especially those in the alcove to the south.  To the north there seems
to be a single room where the door is slightly ajar.  There are rumors
of a haunted room in the Dragon Tooth Inn.</LongDescription>
