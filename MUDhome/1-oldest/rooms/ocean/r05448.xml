  <Name>Hafnia Mountain Road/Tasletek Village Road</Name>
  <ShortDescription>Just off the road is a tiny mountain village called Tasletek.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Five small homes and shops lie to the northwest, built on the edge of
a deep gorge along the east end of the village.  From here, it looks
like a traveler could get a hot meal and a warm bed for the night in the
inn near the middle of the small community.  The mountain road continues
to climb eastward, and drop off to the west.</LongDescription>
