  <ShortDescription>You are in an upstairs hallway in the Boar's Arse Pub.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a only one large room at the end of the hall.  Looks like a meeting
place of some kind.  There is a small crowd, and a speaker is at the front
of the room.  You see a red banner on the wall, with a white circle on it.
An upraised fist, with a single finger erect, is inside the circle.</LongDescription>
