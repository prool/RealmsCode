  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Delaney Drive, west of the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the Cathedral of Worldly Bliss is located to the east of
here.  A large monument in the center of the square depicts the entire world
and the various sections of religious control.  On the west side of the road
is Martha's World of Water and Ice.  Clean, fresh water is usually a rare
commodity, and ice is even more so.  </LongDescription>
