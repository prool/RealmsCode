  <ShortDescription>You are in a most exquisite archery tackle and fletching shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The small room is neat as a pin, and the work bench has all the tools in
a neat rack nearby.  There is a crossbow on the bench which looks to be
completely finished.  A small blue ball, shining brightly, lies beside it.
The room is so tiny, and you are so big, that you have probably scared
everyone into hiding.</LongDescription>
