  <Name>Uland's Long Dock End</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the end of a long dock, often home to the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Widow Maker sometimes moors here at the end of the dock for a few days,
making Uland Island her home port while she waits for the weather to change.
This is a deepwater dock, meant for large ships.  Merchant ships also tie up
here, but seldom when the Widow Maker is in port.  A tangy smell of salt air
and decaying fish is in the air.  Several fishermen are on the dock today.</LongDescription>
