  <ShortDescription>The forest path seems to split here, going around a large oak tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path to the northwest leads towards a freshly cleared area where
you can smell cooking and woodsmoke in the air.  The trees don't seem
as dense in that direction.  The path crosses over a small footbridge
spanning a friendly little creek running to the north.  The eastern
path leads deeper into the dark part of the forest, while the southern
path may lead out of the Enchanted Forest.</LongDescription>
