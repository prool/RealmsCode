  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Netherworld Lane, just north of Thenardier's Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Thenardier's Inn is well known for its lack of hospitality and general
vulgarity of the host.  Nonetheless, it is a relatively popular place
because it is very cheap and affordable.  Many travellers, coming through
the eastern city gate, often stop here to get the city's gossip.  Students
also visit the Inn since they really can't afford to eat anywhere else,
and the awful brew they serve here is relatively cheap.</LongDescription>
