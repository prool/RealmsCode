  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, just south of the Farmers houses.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Small residences have been built on the north side of the road to support
the rural farmers and their families.  These small houses allow the 
farmers never to be too far way from their farms in case of emergencies,
since the regular city residences are located a few miles to the east or
north, towards the center of town.</LongDescription>
