  <ShortDescription>You are on Myrr Lane, just east of the intersection with Kista Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the lane is a fence around an empty lot.  On the south
side you see another lot, but a huge multi-branched fungus covers it.  The
fungus seems to writh and move, but only slowly.  There is a path through
the tangled mass, but why would anyone want to walk through it?</LongDescription>
