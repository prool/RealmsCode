  <ShortDescription>You are on the north side of the Avatar Ruins, walking along Hofton Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mysterious Avatar Ruins, located to the south of the road, is said to
be the site of a massive meeting of a number of avatars fighting for control
of the lands and its people.  The result being massive destruction of just
about all the lands.  It is said that this battle created the oceans, which
previously did not exist.  The water is salty because of the blood spilled
by the avatars.</LongDescription>
