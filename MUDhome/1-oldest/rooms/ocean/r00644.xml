  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Necropolis Avenue, between the Bushman Estates.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Robert Bushman is one of the richest men in Oceancrest, primarily because
of his large estate.  The Plantation on the east grows much of the basic
commodities that the city requires to survive.  The Farms on the west side
of the road produce nearly all of the fruits and vegetables consumed by 
the city.  </LongDescription>
