  <ShortDescription>You are in a rather large General Store with everything imaginable on sale.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Bysantal prides himself on being able to get just about anything anyone
wants, for a reasonable price.  The general store is proof of this fact.
Everything from mountain climbing gear to torches and lanterns may be
bought here.  The exit back to the street is to the west and the Angry
Camper Hunting Supplies shop is located to the south.  It is a small
subsidiary of Bysantal's shop.</LongDescription>
