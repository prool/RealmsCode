  <ShortDescription>This is where Tristram comes to relax after a long day spying on mortals.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walls of this room are covered with beautiful tapestries from all
parts of the world.  Each tapestry is partially transparent, and by
squinting your eyes you can see through them to the parts of the world
from which they come.  Behind one tapestry you can see some of your
friends fighting a monster, as if in a movie.</LongDescription>
