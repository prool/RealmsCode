  <ShortDescription>You are on the forward bow of the dreaded pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are at the very front end of the large pirate ship Widow Maker. 
Looking up you can see the crow's nest high above the ship, and the
aft deck towards the rear of the ship.  This part of the ship is a bit
higher than most of the rest of the main deck, allowing you to see what's
going on throughout the ship.</LongDescription>
