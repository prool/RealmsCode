  <Name>The Timid Camel Fine Imports Shop</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The Timid Camel is the name of a caravan from the Kia'tra Desert.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Since not many people like to travel through the desert, goods from
the other side of the world seldom ever reach Oceancrest, and even
moreso the other way around.  Various interesting daggers and swords
from a completely different society are for sale here, but at a very
expensive price.  </LongDescription>
