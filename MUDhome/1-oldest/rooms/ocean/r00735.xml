  <ShortDescription>You are walking over a beautiful bridge passing over a rapidly flowing river.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you look over the railings of the bridge, you can see the wide river
bringing cold and fresh water down from the mountains into the large park
to the west.  The river appears to flow evenly into the forest-like wooded 
park, bringing fresh water from the mountain icepacks.</LongDescription>
