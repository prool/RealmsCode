  <LongDescription>The Chug-A-Lug Pub is a pretty filthy night club where various people of
any class go to have a fairly good time, depending on what one's definition
of a good time is.  The entrance to the Pub is located on the west side of
the building off of Melbourne Avenue.  On the south side of the street is
the Generic Clerical Supply shop where various articles of religion may
be purchased.</LongDescription>
