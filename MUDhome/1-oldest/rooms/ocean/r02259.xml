  <Name>Lafyette's Blacksmithing and Repairs</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in Lafyette's foundry, where Lafeyette will fix your weapons.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lafyette also fixes armors and almost anything else that can be broken.
Repairing metals is a costly job, though, and will require quite a bit
of gold from you if you want it repaired.  If it's too expensive for you,
then there's a trash recycling facility in this same complex on the 
west side of Melbourne Avenue.</LongDescription>
