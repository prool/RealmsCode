  <ShortDescription>You have reached the northern interior iron gate of Castle Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You may continue around the perimeter of the castle, or take the south
hallway to the castle's center court.  You would think this place would 
be deathly quiet, but there's an odd moaning sound drifting through the
hallways.  Occasionally, it seems to turn into a low cackle.</LongDescription>
