  <Name>Descending Cavern</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The cavern you are in steadily heads downward towards the east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Even though it appears that you can't get any lower into the ground, the
cavern continues to descend into the depths of the planet.  To the west,
you can barely make out a light on the upward slope.  Unfortunately,
there isn't much light down here, so you can't really see anything.</LongDescription>
