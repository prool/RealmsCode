  <ShortDescription>This is the Bronhaven village dump.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The disposal is swarming with flies and rats, searching for any scrap of
food (or dung) they can get their nasty little teeth into.  Boy, does this
garbage heap stink.  If you drop anything, you'll never get it back.</LongDescription>
