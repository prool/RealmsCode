  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lelion Way, south of the Temple of Kurtulmak.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road, you can see the kobold Temple of Kurtulmak,
the chief diety of the kobold pantheon.  Kurtulmak is a hateful diety, 
despising all races except kobolds and works to destroy life for everyone
else.  Kobolds are usually only found in the sewers, but occasionally
they can be seen entering the temple.</LongDescription>
