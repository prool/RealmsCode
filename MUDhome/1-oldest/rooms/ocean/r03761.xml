  <ShortDescription>You are on the stairs between the cellar and main floor of the Orphanage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Directly above you is the main room to the orphanage, and further down,
below the stair landing, is the cellar of the old building.  The steps
squeak as you move, probably alerting anyone who might be listening.
There is a strong odor wafting up the stairwell from the damp cellar below.</LongDescription>
