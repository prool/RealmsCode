  <ShortDescription>This room in the museum is a tribute to Children's Fantasy.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This exhibit is usually of interest to everyone, since there is a child in
all of us.  The things you see here are not very dangerous in reality, but
they do look terribly frightening at first.  Small but exotic animals from
all over the land have been brought here for the children's pleasure.</LongDescription>
