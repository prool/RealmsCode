  <ShortDescription>You are in a cloud over the western end of Vallenda Pass.  40.n2.e0.s0.w25</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are also near the southwestern end of Mount Aphinix, which is the home
of a clan of mountain trolls that occasionally try to invade surrounding
cities.  Long ago, the village of brownhaven had a pitched battle with
them, and almost wiped them out.  Now, they are mostly just a nuisance.</LongDescription>
