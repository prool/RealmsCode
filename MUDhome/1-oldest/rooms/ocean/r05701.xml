  <ShortDescription>You are on the road between Phexton Village and Hafnia Mountain Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking south you see one of the watch towers that used to be used as a
lookout for warring trolls.  North is the village of Phexton, home to a
race of peaceful giants who enjoy mountain life rather than the confines of
a city.  Giants are not very smart, and are difficult to anger, but once
they do get mad, its hard to stop them from destroying everything they see.</LongDescription>
