  <ShortDescription>You have entered the secret chambers of Countess Brianna.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Countess Brianna has long since thought to have been destroyed as a 
vampire, as she hasn't been seen for ages.  Unfortunately, it appears that
she has just been hibernating until she could regain enough strength
to re-enter the world of the living.  There is a large coffin in the 
center of the room which is used by the Countess when she is resting.
Since the Labyrinth is so far underground, she doesn't really need to
escape from the light of the sun since it never really gets down this
far.</LongDescription>
