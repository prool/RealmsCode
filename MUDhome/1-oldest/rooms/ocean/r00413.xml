  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lorian Parkway, between the Evenborough Inn on the
east and the Red-Eye Pub and Grill on the west side of the road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Inn covers nearly one city block square, catering to the
weary adventurers wandering in from the north gate for a good nights rest.
On the west side of the road is the Red-Eye Pub and Grill, where many
adventurers come to discuss what perils lie ahead should they be venturing
out of the town.</LongDescription>
