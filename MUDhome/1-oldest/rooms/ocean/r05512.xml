  <ShortDescription>This is the eastern side of the circular drive around Hafnia.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road is the Hafnia Public Library, a depository
of much of the history and lore of the elven culture.  You probably can
learn the entire story of how the war between the mountain trolls and the
elves got started, and the outcome of it, if you are willing to do the
research.  The library is open twentyfour hours a day.</LongDescription>
