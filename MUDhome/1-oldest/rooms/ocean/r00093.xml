  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on a north-south street known as Brownhaven Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large mansion with a gated wall sits on beautifully kept grounds to the
west.  Large trees grow close to the wall, and limbs hang over to the other
side.  The gate appears to be locked.  If one were interested in climbing,
these trees certainly look like they could be climbed easily.</LongDescription>
