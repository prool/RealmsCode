  <ShortDescription>Nathan Drive continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a warehouse on the north side of the road, and the entrance seems
to be a little further to the west.  A building with twin minerets stands
to the east a short distance.  Looks like the entrance is around the corner.
There is a clerical supply store next door the the warehouse.</LongDescription>
