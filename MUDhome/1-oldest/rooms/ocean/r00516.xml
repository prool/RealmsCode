  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Marina Way, just west of the Leviathan Fishery.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It is no surprise to see a fishery on the east side of the road, being
that you are so close to Nylandian Bay.  On the west side of the road
is the Leviathan Small Boat Rental shop and a bit to the north is the
Nylandian Bay Shipmaster's Office.  Just beyond these buildings to the
west is the Nylandian Bay itself.  The Bay is usually pretty busy as
much of Oceancrest's commerce comes from the seas.</LongDescription>
