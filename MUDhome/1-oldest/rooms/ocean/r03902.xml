  <ShortDescription>You are in the Holy Order of Corellon Larethian Wedding Chapel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although this chapel is smaller than the main audience chamber outside,
it is no less richly appointed.  Unlike many other races, the elves have
always been very rich, and enjoy showing their wealth in this, their shrine
to Larethian.  A canopy stands near a small altar of white marble, the
place of honor for the bride and groom, and lush, indoor plants create a
wonderful aroma of blooming flowers.</LongDescription>
