  <ShortDescription>You are on Hafnia Mountain Road, west of a traveler's rest stop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>the rest area is quite a bit higher than where you are presently, but the
road is wide and clear along here, making it an easy climb.  The road looks 
cold and bitter to the west, and gusts of wind sweep in that direction.</LongDescription>
