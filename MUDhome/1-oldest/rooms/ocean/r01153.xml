  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Eidenhoft Boulevard and Overland Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Eidenhoft Boulevard takes a turn towards the southwest at this intersection.
The turn looks a little odd, considering how well the other streets in the
city are laid out, but if it continued to the south it would run into the
Ogden Family Villa.  The Ogden family, being one of the richest and most
influential in Oceancrest, paid the city to make the road go around their
house instead of having to move.  Overland Drive heads east and west, and
eventually passes by what most people believe to be a haunted house.</LongDescription>
