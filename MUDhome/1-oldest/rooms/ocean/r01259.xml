  <ShortDescription>You are now standing in the center of this virtually empty circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Apperently, not much was done to keep the center of this circle growing.
The only thing which remains is dead grass and a couple of weeds, but 
even those are withering.  The Allisk Manor is located on the northeastern
corner of the circle, which is where the Circle gets its name.  It is
rumored that the Allisk Manor is still haunted by the ghosts of past 
owners and even Natasha de Allisk herself.  </LongDescription>
