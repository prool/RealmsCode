  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Darmanian Way, north of the great Lyanden Lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The crystal waters of the Lyanden Lake come ashore to the south of the
road, creating a small beach where children often go to play.  The large
lake is supplied by two rivers flowing in from the north and east.  The
high mountains in the east supply most of the water to Oceancrest.</LongDescription>
