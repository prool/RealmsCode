  <ShortDescription>This is a very old and dangerous passage through the Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Even now, years after the Temple was abandoned due to its partial destruction
by earthquakes, the Temple still occasionally shakes, shudders and trembles 
for no apparent reason.  Each tremor seems to bring new damage.  An old
legend says the priests let a spell of some kind get out of control.</LongDescription>
