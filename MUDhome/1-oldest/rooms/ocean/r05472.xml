  <ShortDescription>You are high on the side of a mountain, traveling on a winding road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Not to far above you are the gates to Castle Rutger.  From here, you can
see the towers and spires, and the ramparts guarded by archers.  Flags and
pennants can be seen whipping in the breeze.  There seems to be a level lot
near the gate where you can see a lot of empty carts and wagons waiting to 
be used by merchants and travelers who visit here.</LongDescription>
