  <ShortDescription>You are soaring through the skies above the vast City of Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The clear blue skies over the city are magnificent to soar through.  You
just hope that your fly spell does not wear off.  With the sky as blue
and clear as it is, you're likely to get quite lost if you don't watch
where you're flying.</LongDescription>
