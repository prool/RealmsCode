  <ShortDescription>You are in a small welfare office run by a church group.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is a welfare office run by a group of missionaries from a store-front
church in Oceancrest.  The place used to be a front for a bunch of sly
pawn dealers who bought things with no questions asked.  But no more.  Now
the bible thumpers run it, having chased out the previous owner.  They say
they plan to clean up the entire island, but everyone just laughs at that.</LongDescription>
