  <Name>Dairy Production and Storage Facility</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the small dairy production facility where elves are busy
milking cows and making all sorts of dairy products for the town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The town of Kista is rather small and requires a minimal amount of 
dairy cows to produce their necessary dietary requirements.  However,
some of the cheeses that come out of this plant are said to be the
very best in the world.  All the cheese is churned by hand making the
process very time consuming.  When the cows are not in their stables,
they are resting in the field enclosed by the facility.</LongDescription>
