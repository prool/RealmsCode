  <Name>Main Street/Nagaritha Drive Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Main Street and Nagaritha Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street intersects Nagaritha Drive here.  Both roads are fairly large
and the intersection of the two results in lots of foot traffic.  Horses
are not real common in most of the town, but seem to be present here.  
To the south, you can see the primary shopping district in this section
of Oceancrest, where just about anything may be traded or bought. </LongDescription>
