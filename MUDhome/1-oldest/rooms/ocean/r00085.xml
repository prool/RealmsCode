  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a number of small shops along here on the south side of the
road.  On the north side is an impressive building where a lot of noise
can be heard.  There are posters plastered all over the building's wall,
and it looks like you could challenge a gladitor, if you wanted to.</LongDescription>
