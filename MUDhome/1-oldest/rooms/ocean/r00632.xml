  <ShortDescription>Lankshire Parkway continues through the farm land to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Bushman Farms fruit and vegetable garden feeds virtually all
of Oceancrest.  Although fruits are not in great demand here, they are
nevertheless required as a good source of vitamins.  The Bushman Farms
does fairly good business with both the city and as an exporter to other
less fortunate towns.</LongDescription>
