  <ShortDescription>You are inside the north village gate of Brownhaven.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This gate is closed at sundown to avoid being overrun by mountain trolls
and other unwelcome creatures.  Promptly at sunrise the gates are opened to
traffic.  Most of the stuff you see in the shops in Brownhaven is brought in
by travelers or the monthly caravan.  South is the intersection of Goldenrod
Avenue and Main Street.</LongDescription>
