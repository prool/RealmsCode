  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the foremost part of the Ringmaster's tent.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking around, you see very well kept living quarters.  The Ringmaster's
wife keeps this tent very clean and still has time for her mystical
endeavors.  Some say she is more powerful than the Ringmaster himself
because of her abilities in the magical realms.  Her part of the tent is
filled with artifacts from far places.  The Ringmaster does not seem to
have many possessions as he is out performing most of the time.  His wife
decorates the tent nicely, though not expensively.</LongDescription>
