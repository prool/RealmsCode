  <ShortDescription>You certainly want to go into the arena with good armor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A big, dumb looking half-giant stands behind the counter, wearing a
leather apron and a slack-jawed look.  His eyes are quite dull, so don't
ask for advice.  He might give you some, and if you took it, you might be
sorry.  He has a list of armor for sale.  If you are looking for small-race
armor, why don't you try across the street?</LongDescription>
