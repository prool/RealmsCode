  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the northern path around the Barbarian Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east, you can see a small trading post which is set up to allow
the wealthier barbarians to buy some larger sized armor to better 
protect themselves.  Most barbarians tend to either go naked or just
wear a loincloth.  Very few are able to afford some of the higher
quality metallic and leather armors.  Furthermore, not many people 
actually make that large of size of armor.</LongDescription>
