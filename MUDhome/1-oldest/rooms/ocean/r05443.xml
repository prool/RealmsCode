  <ShortDescription>A snow covered bank is on either side, providing some shelter from the wind.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Deep wagon ruts in the snow and mud make it difficult to stay on the road,
but its best to stay here.  Many a party of adventurers have become lost 
after deciding to cut across country.  Pretty soon one rocky peak begins
to look like the other.</LongDescription>
