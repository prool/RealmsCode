  <Name>Adamantine Dragon's Cave</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the giant cavern which the Adamantine Dragon calls home.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Adamantine Dragon is perhaps the greatest dragon in the land, but because
she is still so young, her powers of magic are not yet fully developed.  But
even at this point, Elise is considered a master of magic and wizardry.  The
Adamantine Dragon may someday be more powerful than the Platinum Dragon.
Although this cave is huge, the Adamantine Dragon will grow larger with age
and will one day fill it completely.</LongDescription>
