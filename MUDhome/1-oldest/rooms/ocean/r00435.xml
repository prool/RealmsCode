  <LongDescription>Knowledge is essential to all societies, and making knowledge public
strengthens the society.  The Municipal Library is nothing compared to
the University Library or the Ministry of Knowledge, but it does provide
the average citizens of Oceancrest with basic knowledge about whatever
they might be interested in.</LongDescription>
