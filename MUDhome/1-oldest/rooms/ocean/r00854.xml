  <Name>Dark Stairwell</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have stumbled into a dark, dank stairwell that leads downward into
some well-lit hallways.  Looking up, you can see the strange reflections
of the Crystal Alcove.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The stairwell is rather unremarkable and made of old, creaking boards
that will probably break as soon as you step on them.  Miraculously, 
they don't but it's best not to stay on them for very long.</LongDescription>
