  <ShortDescription>You are in a glimmering hallway of gold and jewels.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Citadel's Hallway continues to the north and south.  To the north,
you can see two great gates, but can't quite make out exactly where
they go.  You can see some writing on the walls up ahead, but that's
about it.  To the south, you can see two large oak doors that appear
to lead out back into the city.  The walls are surrounded with gold
and jewels.  Portraits of apparently great dragons line the walls on
both sides.  You fees a cold gust of wind hit you as you continue to
explore this strange place.</LongDescription>
