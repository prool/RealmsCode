  <ShortDescription>This is the preparation area for the knight's jousting run.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side is the main building of Castle Ragnar, and on the west
side is a large hedge.  Together they form a natural alcove for the wide
alley just to the south which is used as a jousting run.  Further south
is the small arms practice area.  Prince Ragnar himself can often be found
here, either participating or watching the knights as they charge down
the jousting run.</LongDescription>
