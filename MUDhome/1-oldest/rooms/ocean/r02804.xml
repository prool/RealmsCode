  <ShortDescription>You are walking down a damp and dusty hallway carved from the rocks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Strangely, the walls of the hallway are perfectly square.  It's almost
like you're walking through a regular building, except the walls are 
composed of granite and ice.  The hallway continues to the north and
south.  An eerie silence continues as you walk around the desolate hall.</LongDescription>
