  <ShortDescription>There is an odd sign on the east side of the road reading "The Glyph Master".</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Riverdell Way continues to the north and south, traveling through the
eastern section of town.  On the east side of the road is a funny shop
called "The Glyph Master", a sort of fortune telling/deciphering store
where you can probably figure out what a number of the cryptic scrolls
and writings mean.</LongDescription>
