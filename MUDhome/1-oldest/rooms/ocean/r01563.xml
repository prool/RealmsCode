  <Name>Middle Circle of Etolos</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are travelling around the middle path circling Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The circle you are on continues to the east and west around the complex.
You notice that the outer circle seems to disappear into the large field
to the north, where you can see a lot of activity.  It looks somewhat
like an exercise yard where the druids go to play games after a long day
of studying and meditating.</LongDescription>
