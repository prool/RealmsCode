  <ShortDescription>You are in the center of Tasletek Village, near Hafnia Mountain Road.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Snow Flower Inn is the largest of the five buildings in the village. 
looks like a few retired hobbits have settled here, from the signs on 
the doors.  Toby's appears to be a smithy, while Trabin might sell a few
pieces of armor and weapons.  Tillie runs a small pawn shop.</LongDescription>
