  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Adlermann Way, west of Josie's Ropery Shop.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Josie's Ropery provides people with high quality rope and other climbing
goods to get around the caverns beneath the city as well as in the mountains
to the east of the city.  Both are potentially very dangerous and one 
should always carry rope and other mountain climbing equipment if they 
intend to climb.</LongDescription>
