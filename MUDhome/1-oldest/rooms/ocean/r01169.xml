  <Name>Eidenhoft Boulevard/Main Street Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Eidenhoft Boulevard and Main Street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Main Street runs east to west and intersects Eidenhoft Boulevard which is a
popular north south throughfare.  There are a lot of little shops along Main
Street, and many of them have strange and unfamiliar things on display.  
Most merchandise comes from far off lands, brought here by seamen hoping
to earn a little gold before wasting it at the pubs.  Over on the southwest
corner is a shop called, "Dante's Daggers and Darts."  The entrance is just
off of Main Street.</LongDescription>
