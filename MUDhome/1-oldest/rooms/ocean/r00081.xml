  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A small park is on the south side of Plasnelt Road.  Trees and gardens
with well kept paths can be seen.  There are park benches, and if you
are in need of rest, it might be a nice place to sit and think for awhile.
You might consider this:  Why does everyone want to kill everything in
sight?  What's the meaning of this cycle of death followed by life?</LongDescription>
