  <ShortDescription>You are in a southern block of the crystalline city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The structures in this section of the crystalline city seem to be of greater
importance to the citizens than the other buildings.  A huge, hexagon shaped
building made entirely of sapphire is apparently a military complex, as you
see crystalline guards and warriors marching endlessly in and out of it.</LongDescription>
