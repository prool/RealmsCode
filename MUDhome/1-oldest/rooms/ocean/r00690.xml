  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Darmanian Way, south of the Hofton Ziggurat.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Hofton Ziggurat towers over the landscape with its unique pyramid
shape rising towards the heavens.  It is not nearly as tall as the
Lyanden Castle, which you can see to the south on the lake, but never-
theless, it is quite an impressive work of art.</LongDescription>
