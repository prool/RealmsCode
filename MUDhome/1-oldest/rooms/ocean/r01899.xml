  <ShortDescription>You are in the Davis Brothers Mortuary, viewing all the dead bodies.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A mortuary isn't always the funnest place to visit.  In fact, it's down-
right boring.  You might be able to find some friends who have died in
battle in the Arena or have fallen down a mountain.  The mortuary exits
to the west onto Marina Way, and east to Eidenhoft Boulevard.  </LongDescription>
