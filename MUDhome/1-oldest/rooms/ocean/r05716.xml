  <ShortDescription>You are in the village warehouse, and see a long hall of locked rooms.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a wide stairway, with steps so far spaced you would have to hoist
yourself up to climb them.  There is also a hole in one wall which you
could probably crawl through.  If it wasn't so big, you would swear it 
was a mouse hole.</LongDescription>
