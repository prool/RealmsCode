  <ShortDescription>You are in the eastern tower stairwell which winds around the large tower.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A wonderful fragrance comes from the top of the stairs, but there is also
a smell of decay as well.  The stairs have not been used in a very long 
time.  Seems as though every time you take a step on the stairs it doesn't
seem as though you have gotten any closer to your goal.</LongDescription>
