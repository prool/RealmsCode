  <ShortDescription>You are on a sloping gravel bank near the Ashton creek.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>near the top of the slope is a stand of ancient trees, thick with
moss at ground level.  The gravel bank is bare of vegetation and
extends for at least a hundred meters in either direction along the
creek.  Close to the water you can see an exposed vein of what looks
like gold!  In the distance you can see the path continues through
the forest in in a northerly direction and also to the southeast.</LongDescription>
