  <ShortDescription>You are on the midway of the annual Carnival and Sideshow in Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Excited groups of people make their along here, and the noise level is
pretty high.  Bright flags and banners fly overhead, and the tents are in
wild colors, many of them multi-hued in stripes, and some with odd symbols
painted on them.  Wedged between two large tents you see a small one with
an old silver star hanging over the entrance.  </LongDescription>
