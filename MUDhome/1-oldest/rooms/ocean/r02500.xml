  <ShortDescription>You are standing in the vast park on the west shore of Lake Lyanden.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large park stands as a gathering place for the people of the city to
hear the royal decrees from the Speaker of Lyanden Castle, Lord Ponternal.
The drawbridge is located to the east, but as is usually the case, the
drawbridge is raised.  There appears to be a small guard station to the
east near the drawbridge.</LongDescription>
