  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Netherworld Lane, north of the Necropolis.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The entrance to the massive Necropolis lies to the west at the intersection
of Netherworld Lane and Necropolis Avenue.  The large Necropolis lies to
the south, surrounded by iron gates that keep graverobbers from defiling
the gravesites and buildings.  Security is pretty tight so there haven't
been too many incidents lately.  The Bushman Plantation is located to the
north.  It is also owned by Reginald Bushman and is used to grow soybeans
and other comodities.  As usual, he is always looking for some cheap,
unskilled labor.</LongDescription>
