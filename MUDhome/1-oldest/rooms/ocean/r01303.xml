  <ShortDescription>You are walking along an oddly quiet section of Riverdell Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Despite the fact that the East Oceancrest City Guard Barracks are located
to the east of the road, Riverdell Way is strangely quiet as you walk
along the street.  To the west is a dense forest covered with shrubs,
trees and other brush.</LongDescription>
