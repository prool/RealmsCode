  <Name>West Tower Stairway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the stairway leading up the western tower of the Kista Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tower staircase appears to spiral up infinitely into the sky.  The
further you progress up the stairway, the further away the top appears
to get.  There is an odd, musty smell in the stairwell that puzzles 
you.  It doesn't look like this stairway is used often, although you
know the towers are inhabited.  There must be some sort of great magic
at the top of these stairs.</LongDescription>
