  <ShortDescription>You are in the Goblin's most holy sacrificial church.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the place where the goblin masses gather to hear their priests
exort them to kill all humans and elves, for the good of their souls.
When they have been worked into a frenzy by the priests, they are sent
out to bring back prisoners to be turned over to the priesthood.  There
are candles in niches in the walls here, providing a soft glow and 
flickering shadows on the rough walls.</LongDescription>
