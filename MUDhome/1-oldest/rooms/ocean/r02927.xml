  <Name>Swampy Path Through the Forest</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are walking on a slightly muddy path with swampy water on both sides.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The path is the only clear way through the swamp, but it's not very
pleasant.  Moss hangs from the branches, and you have to continually
push it out of your way.  Water snakes slide away as you make your way
along the path, and water spiders glare menacingly at you.  The brush
is so thick you can't see very far in any direction.</LongDescription>
