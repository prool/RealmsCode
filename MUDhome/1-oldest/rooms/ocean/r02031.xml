  <ShortDescription>You are on Tower Lane, directly in front of the Kista Towers to the north.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a guard house to the north that leads into the Towers, but
you can see that the drawbridge is still up.  Swimming through the
moat doesn't sound like a very smart thing to do.  To the south is the
main town meeting hall.  The meeting hall is usually pretty busy most
of the day, but is used for social gatherings in the evenings as well.
The entry for the Town Hall is on Pearl Avenue.</LongDescription>
