  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Hofton Avenue, south of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive City Walls on the north side of the road are a constant 
reminder of what lies outside the city.  Although there hasn't really
been a major offensive against the city in over half a century, the
threat of invasion is always present and the city garrison is always in
top form, ready to take on any threat that might come its way.</LongDescription>
