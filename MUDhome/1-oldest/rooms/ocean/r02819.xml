  <ShortDescription>You are in a strange, triangular room, covered with gold and jewels.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The odd shaped room gets wider to the north, with the door forming the
apex of the triangle.  There is some arcane, ancient writing on the wall
which reads "Those who seek wisdom will prevail.  Those who seek gold
will die."  There are odd symbols around the room, but otherwise, the
room is quite empty.</LongDescription>
