  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Hofton Avenue, just north of the Embassy Court.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The two predominant minority races in Oceancrest are the elves and dwarves.
Both races have cities of their own, and the embassies to the south provide
their people with a link to their heritage.  In addition, the embassies 
provide a unified, political voice to the government with sympathies towards
their own race. </LongDescription>
