  <Name>Rum Road South/Thieve's Alley Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the corner of Rum Road and a small alley.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The alley is known by the local folk as Thieve's Alley, but perhaps a 
better name would be garbage alley.  The smell of urine and vomit is very
strong, and filth litters the narrow walkway.  Hungry cats seem to be
everywhere, silently watching you.  Your presence has brought a momentary
truce to the war raging between the cats and some very large rats.</LongDescription>
