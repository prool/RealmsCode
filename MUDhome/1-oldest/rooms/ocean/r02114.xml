  <LongDescription>You are in an apple orchid which is tended by Mehetable and her daughters.
The ancient crone lives in the largest of the huts you see at the east
end of the orchid.  Each of her three beautiful daughters lives in a
separate hut near her.  There are some very special trees growing by the
huts.  Mehetable and her daughters take very good care of this grove.</LongDescription>
