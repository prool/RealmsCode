  <Name>The Hot Mud Pits</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The slimy mud is said to have theraputic effects on the body.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A large number of half-giants usually come here to rest after a long
battle against nearly impossible odds.  As usual, they return victorious,
but heavily wounded.  The mud, although quite dirty and very smelly,
appears to help them recover much faster than the Shaman can personally
tend to each of them.</LongDescription>
