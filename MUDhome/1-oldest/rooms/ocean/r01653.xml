  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Amberton Lane and Monument Avenue.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Amberton Lane was not so lucky when the mages of Keslar decided that 
this would be a good place to put a mountain, and subsequently destroyed
a portion of Amberton Lane.  In order to continue on Amberton Lane, you
must go east on Monument and then head north on Levaithan.  You may then
take any western-heading road back to Amberton.  </LongDescription>
