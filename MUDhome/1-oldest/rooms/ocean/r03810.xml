  <Name>Snake Charmers' Side Show</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You have found yourself amongst snake charmers in their exotic sideshow.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You see snakes and snake charmers of all descriptions about you.  The
basket to the side is filled with several varities, and a young lady
wearing pantaloons and an open vest reaches for one.  A tiny, wizened
old human sits in a circle of snakes and charms them with his rythmic
movement of his body.  Everywhere you look there are snakes and people
handling them.  They don't seem to be watching all of them very carefully,
though, as a couple just slithered beneath the canvas of the tent.</LongDescription>
