  <ShortDescription>You are in a heavy and wet fog bank, making it difficult to see anything.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There's nothing but a whiteness all around you, and at times it's so dense
you cannot even see the dragon on which you are mounted.  However, if you
let the dragon find his own way out, it might be a little faster than you
trying to do it.</LongDescription>
