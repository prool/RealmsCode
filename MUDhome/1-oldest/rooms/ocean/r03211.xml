  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lake View Road, which runs north toward the lake.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lake View Road takes you around the town's grainery and dairy storage
areas bringing you towards Lake Kista.  The beautiful blue water of
the lake is almost always near freezing, even in the short summers here.  
The crystal-blue waters and snow-white shores are lovely to look at, though.</LongDescription>
