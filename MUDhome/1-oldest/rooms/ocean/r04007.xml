  <ShortDescription>You are in a tiny alcove with only one direction to go.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Apparently, someone long ago sealed the hallway here.  The bricks blocking
the hall are newer, and of a different kind than the bricks in the wall.
Scrawled on the wall is the word, "BEWARE" and under it is an icon of 
a wolf, with dripping fangs.  On the same wall is the cryptic, "YAB 371."</LongDescription>
