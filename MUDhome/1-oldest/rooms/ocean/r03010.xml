  <ShortDescription>This is the entrance to the lair of the goblins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>If you are looking for the underground city and its legendary Emerald Armor,
you have clearly found the ghetto of the fabled city.  Goblins and other
nasty small creatures roam these dark tunnels and hallways, always looking
for the flesh of others.  Humans and goblins have long been at war with
each other, but their past skirmishes were unrewarding to both sides, so
now they simply keep their distance.  If you are human, be especially
watchful.  If you are alone, you will probably be a feast for a goblin
family soon.</LongDescription>
