  <ShortDescription>You are on a sandy road which is part of the Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the southwest is a stretch of white, sandy beach which should give a
good view of Nylandian Bay and the ships anchored there.  Wisps of fog
creep in and curl around the landscape, partially obscuring your view,
but what you see looks interesting.  To the north you can see a group
of tents with flags and banners whipping in the breeze coming from the
bay.  The Oceancrest carnival and fair is opened every spring over there.</LongDescription>
