  <ShortDescription>You are in the large public room of the Snow Flower Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This looks like a good place to relax and take off your armor.  The smell
of hot food from the kitchen is wonderful, and the roaring fire in the 
fireplace feels good after the cold mountain road you have been traveling 
on.  The innkeeper's name is Trago, a small, fat hobbit with an even fatter
wife.  Several customers are here.</LongDescription>
