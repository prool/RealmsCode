  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Golden Dolphin Way, south of the Golden Dolphin Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Golden Dolphin Inn is directly to the north.  You can see through 
some of the windows to see that it is a modestly priced inn with just
moderate quality service.  Although well kept, it lacks some of the
glitter and money that some of the other, fancier inns have, such as
the Dragon's Tooth Inn.</LongDescription>
