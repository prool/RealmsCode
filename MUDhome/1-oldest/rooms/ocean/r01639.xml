  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Road in the residental area of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Oceancrest is kind of divided into a number of major sections.  You are
in the southeastern section of town, which is primarily a residental
sector.  There are a number of general purpose stores and small pubs 
for the average citizens in this area.  On the east side of the road,
you can see the Order of the White Rose building where Paladins go to
get their basic training skills.</LongDescription>
