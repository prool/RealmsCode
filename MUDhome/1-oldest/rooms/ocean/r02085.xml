  <Name>Elven Dignitary's Quarters</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in the quarters of Illia, elven dignitary from Riverdell.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Illia is usually at her desk, signing papers and other important documents.
She is a strong fighter from the elven community of Riverdell and is 
considered an expert bowyer.  The elven city of Riverdell is quite a
distance to the north of Kista, so Illia tends to stay here for many
days or even weeks at a time.  Her quarters are less lavish and not
decorated near as much as Travis' and Drowlin's quarters.</LongDescription>
