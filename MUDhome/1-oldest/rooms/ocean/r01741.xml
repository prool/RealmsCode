  <LongDescription>It is important to note that riding a horse in town, especially in a busy
section of town, is dangerous to both the pedestrians and to the horse.
Therefore, a large stable has been placed near the eastern entrance to the
city for the convinience of the guests.  There are also a number of small
inns near the eastern gates where visitors may relax after a long day of
riding.</LongDescription>
