  <ShortDescription>This is Brownhaven's southern bridge over the Baldywyne River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The water flows from the heights of the mysterious Mount Caledonia, which
has never been fully mapped.  Many adventurers have made expeditions to
it, but few have returned.  The water is cold and refreshing, and is the
main source of drinking water for the village.</LongDescription>
