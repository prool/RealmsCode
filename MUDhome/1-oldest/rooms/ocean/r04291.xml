  <ShortDescription>You are in the magical waters of the courtyard pool in the Tower Castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Statues around you are arranged in an orderly fashion to tell the story of
the twin sons born to King Lyanden at Lyanden Castle.  The midwife died
under mysterious circumstances shortly after their births, and thereby was
lost the order of birth between Ragnar and Rutger.  Now no one knows which
is the elder of the brothers, nor which is the rightful successor to the 
throne at Lyanden Court.</LongDescription>
