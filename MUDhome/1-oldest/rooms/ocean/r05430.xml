  <LongDescription>There is an old watch tower on the north side of the road farther west.
The road you are on continues to climb towards the east where there is a 
lot of snow to be seen.  the road also drops swiftly to the west.  At times
there are hairpin turns and it's impossible to see very far along the road
when that occurs.</LongDescription>
