  <ShortDescription>This is the Men's Restroom in the Dragon Tooth Inn.  It's not very clean.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As a matter of fact, there's nothing here in the way of plumbing, either.
The room is quite bare except for a dark hole in the floor, and there's an
awful smell coming from the hole.  The floor is wet where a few drunks have
missed their opportunity, so it's a good thing you are wearing boots.</LongDescription>
