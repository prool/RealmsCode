  <ShortDescription>You are on the second level of the Royal Stairway in Rutger's Tower Castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a hallway going west which seems to be bustling with clerks and
accountants, all of them busy with the the paperwork of the castle.  Most
people never consider how much administrative work is associated with the
workings of a castle, but just stop one of these clerks, and you will see
just how upset he can become over being delayed in his work.</LongDescription>
