  <ShortDescription>You are on the slopes of Hafnia Mountain, south of the Ituk Glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Snow swirls around you, and at this elevation snow stays on the ground all
year round.  Several times a year the road crew finds a frozen traveler,
so be warned.  This is not a friendly part of the world.  There is an odd
occurance of a hot draft of wind occasionally from the south, probably from
one of the active cinder cones that make up the Aphinix Mountain Range.</LongDescription>
