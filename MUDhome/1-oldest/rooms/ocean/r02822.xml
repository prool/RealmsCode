  <Name>Dark Hallway</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the southeastern corner of the desolate and dark hallway.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The seldom used hallway appears to be left over from the time when the
caverns were being built.  The hall doesn't appear to fit into the main
scheme of the hallway layout and looks even dustier than the main hallways.
The dark hallway continues to the north and west.</LongDescription>
