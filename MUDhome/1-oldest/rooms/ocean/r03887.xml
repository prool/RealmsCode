  <Name>Long Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a long, damp tunnel with cold, clammy walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The tunnel has been turning sharply, and doesn't seem to follow a straight
path for more than a few meters.  Occasionally you have to climb either up
down to continue through these broken tunnels.  This is very baffling.</LongDescription>
