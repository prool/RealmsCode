  <LongDescription>Hillcrest Drive runs to the east and west from here, extending the city's
boundaries further to the east to encompass the great Allakaren Pyramid.
Riverdell Way is a north-south street.  About a block to the north, there
is a large oak tree in the center of a small traffic circle.  The Tree has
been here longer than the city.  Small shops line the west side of the road.</LongDescription>
