  <ShortDescription>You are near the entrance to the chapel used by the knights of the castle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The open door lets you see that the chapel is a small place with a simple
altar and a confessional booth.  Confession is good for the soul, and 
several knights evidently want a good soul, as there is a line to the booth.</LongDescription>
