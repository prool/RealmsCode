  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Hillcrest Drive, north of the Regalia Convent.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the south side of the road, you can see the magnificent Regalia Convent,
known not really for the word that they spread, but the philosophy of an
monotheistic deity, which is usually considered blasphemous by literally
every major religion in Oceancrest, including some of the orc and 
bugbear religions, which are also outcasted among the holy order of 
sacred, acceptable religions.</LongDescription>
