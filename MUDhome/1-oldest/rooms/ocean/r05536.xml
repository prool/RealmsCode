  <ShortDescription>You are on the northern Nyrron trail, walking beside the Nyyron Creek. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the south the trail continues out of sight around a great boulder, while
to the north you see a recent avalanch has wiped out part of the path.  The
mountain sides here are steep and rugged, and slides occur often.  If you
follow the creek, however, it should take you back to the trail.</LongDescription>
