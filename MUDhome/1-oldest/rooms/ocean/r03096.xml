  <ShortDescription>You are in a secret passageway in the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This passage has not been used in a very long time.  The priests who used
to worship here left after a series of earthquakes destroyed most of the
temple, making it very unsafe.  Many of the stones you see look like they
could fall at any moment.  There is a bad odor along here.</LongDescription>
