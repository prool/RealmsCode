  <LongDescription>The Cathedral of Veratus stands proudly to the northwest.  The entrance
to the Cathedral is to the west.  Pearl Avenue runs through the center
of the city heading past the great Towers.  To the south, you can see 
a number of archers practicing on a large field.  Better not get too 
close, or you might be catching arrows. </LongDescription>
