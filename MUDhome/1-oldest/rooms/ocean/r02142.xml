  <Name>Pixie Glenn</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in small glen, surrounded by a riot of wildflowers in bloom.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You feel a little lightheaded because of the pixie dust in the air.  As
you stand here, the air snaps and sparkles as pixies dart about.  There
is a tension in in the air as well, as though magic was all about you.
The glenn is totally surrounded by a tall hedge, and a gap can be seen
to the south.  To the north, on the other side of the hedge, you hear a
yowling noise like a tomcat in heat.</LongDescription>
