  <Name>Southern Castle Wall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the southern hallway that runs around the castle's interior.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evidently the fire couldn't do much damage here, as it seems to be mostly
stonework.  A wide, iron door with rusted hinges is set into the west wall.
The hallway continues to the northeast and to the northwest, curving out of
sight in both directions.  There is a great hallway to the north.</LongDescription>
