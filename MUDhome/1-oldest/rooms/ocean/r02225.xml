  <ShortDescription>You are somewhere inside the Allisk Labyrinth, no doubt quite lost.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are apperently lost inside the Allisk Labyrinth.  The stone-grey walls
appear identical in every direction you look.  Although you feel like you
haven't been in this direction before, you also feel that somehow you're
going around in circles.  The Labyrinth was built many centuries ago and
rumor has it that minotars and flying snakes still roam the corridors 
looking for food.</LongDescription>
