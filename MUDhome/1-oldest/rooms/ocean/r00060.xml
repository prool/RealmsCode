  <ShortDescription>Wall Road West continues to the north and south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>High overhead, there is a copper dragon and rider circling in preparation 
for landing at the pits, which is northeast of here.  The high wall on the
west side blocks any view in that direction, but you know there are low
rolling hills that way, which eventually rise to the Nartiz Mountain Range.
On the east side of the road there is a low fence enclosing the Animal
Training Compound.</LongDescription>
