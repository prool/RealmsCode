  <ShortDescription>This is the large altar dedicated to Maglubyet and maintained by the priests.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Only a few select goblins are ever allowed in here, and no outsider has
ever lived to leave this room.  A blood altar stands ready for its next
victim.  A low, stone table is near the altar, and its top is covered with
various small hand instruments of vivisection.  As you look closely at the
altar you see it has straps to hold the victim in place, and a silver urn
to collect the blood.</LongDescription>
