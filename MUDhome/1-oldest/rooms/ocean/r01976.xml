  <ShortDescription>You are at the Main Entrance to the Ivanhouse Sporting Arena.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At this point, you have a number of choices.  To the north, you may enter
the Beginner's Circle.  Up to three gladiators may engage a single 
opponent.  This area is exclusively for lower-level characters who have
not quite mastered the art of gladiator fighting.  To the northeast is
the Gladiator Pit, a small arena where you may challenge a human gladiator
in one-on-one combat.  To the northwest is the Mul Pit, another small
arena where you may challenge a mul gladiator, a human/dwarven half-breed,
in hand-to-hand combat.  Again, this arena only permits one competitor
at a time.</LongDescription>
