  <ShortDescription>You are outside the gate to the animal training compound.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking inside, you see several separate areas where different animals are
kept and trained.  To the west is the path leading to the road which runs
around the village of Brownhaven.  Overhead, you can see several copper
dragons high in the air with riders on their backs.  The riders seem to be
naked and are carrying long lances, which glint in the light.</LongDescription>
