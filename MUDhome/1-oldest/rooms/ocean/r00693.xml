  <ShortDescription>You are walking down Islandia Drive, between the Park and the Memorial.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Park, located on the south, is a lush, green park covered
with trees and flocks of birds.  Most birds are smart enough to know that
people leave seeds and other trash around the park to eat.  Unfortunately,
they're not smart enough to see that sometimes this is just bait to catch
them with.  Some birds in the park are particularly good in a white cream
sauce garnished with mushrooms.</LongDescription>
