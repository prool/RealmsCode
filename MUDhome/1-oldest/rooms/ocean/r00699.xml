  <ShortDescription>You are on Yellow Marsh Road, just north of the cliffs overlooking Othax.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The River Othax flows smoothly across the plains of the city, originating
from the high mountains outside of Oceancrest, eventually emptying into
the Nylandian Bay.  The relatively modest cliffs to the south might be
interesting to climb, but there doesn't seem to be anything around.  Looking
up, you can see a solitary cloud a bit to the west.</LongDescription>
