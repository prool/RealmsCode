  <Name>Old Tunnel</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow tunnel that is no longer used by the castle's people.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is usually referred to as the old tunnel, when people talk about it,
but most people have forgotten it is even here.  The door to the west is
broken and hangs partially open, while to the east a huge grey stone has
fallen from the ceiling and blocks the way.  Cobwebs cover everything and
the dust makes you sneeze.   There doesn't seem to be anything of interest
here except some sort of crytogram scratched on the wall.</LongDescription>
