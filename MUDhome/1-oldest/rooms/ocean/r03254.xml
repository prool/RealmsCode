  <ShortDescription>You are on a path leading away from Oceancrest, it looks as if it
goes on forever, maybe you are just imagining it.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This road is paved with large yellowish orange bricks, but you were 
never very good at telling colors.  The bricks look like they might 
have some value if you could pry one out, but they look as if they 
were set by powerful magic.</LongDescription>
