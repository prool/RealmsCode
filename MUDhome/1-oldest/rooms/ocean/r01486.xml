  <ShortDescription>You are in the secret library of the Keslar mages.  </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the place where all the great spells of the mages are stored
for safe keeping.  Many spells are one-of-a-kind and you can't even
read the printing on the paper.  A number of potions are spilt on the
ground leading you to believe that this place is also used as some
sort of laboratory for mixing potions and other neat magical items.</LongDescription>
