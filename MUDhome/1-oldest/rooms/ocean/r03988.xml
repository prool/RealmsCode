  <ShortDescription>You are below ground level, and inside a hollow shaft in a great redwood.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A smooth tunnel seems to run towards the southeast from here.  The only
other way you can go is up some ladder rungs you see nailed to the inside 
of the tree.  This is the biggest redwood in the entire forest, and the High
Invoker lives at the top of it.</LongDescription>
