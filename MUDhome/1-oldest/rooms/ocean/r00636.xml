  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Necropolis Avenue, west of Danielle's Mage Emporium.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large complex on the west side of the road that appears to be
fairly popular.  You can hear a lot of cheering and otherwise drunken 
laughter coming from the other side of the building.  The complex has an
entrance on the south side of the building off of Hillborough Way.  On
the east is Danielle's Mystic Mage Emporium, almost every known potion may
be purchased.</LongDescription>
