  <ShortDescription>You are in a narrow, dark tunnel which Xandaus uses for storage purposes.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Wooden boxes and chests with contents unknown are neatly stack on one
side of the tunnel, while on the other side, a large oak rack supports
the weight of numerous potion bottles and vials.  Despite the 
organization of the items, everything seems to be covered in dust.</LongDescription>
