  <ShortDescription>You are on Lake View Road, near the northeast side.  Kista is south of you.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Lake Kista is between the road and the city, and the great range of the
Nartiz Mountains looms to the south.  Over the Gotland Pass just to the
north lies the vast Gotland Glenn.  There are tales of an entire city
built beneath the grasslands out there.</LongDescription>
