  <ShortDescription>You are walking across a bridge spanning the Ashton River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you cross over the ancient bridge over the Ashton River, you can see the
impressive design of the Wakarimasu Park.  The Ashton River is relativly
wide, but that is to be expected as the mountains snows have produced a lot
of water lately.  The river flows west towards the ocean.</LongDescription>
