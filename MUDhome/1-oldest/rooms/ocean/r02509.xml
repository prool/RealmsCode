  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Tiamat Lane, north of the Kista Towers.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Towers soar far into the clouds over your head, making you feel like
a country bumpkin as you tilt your head back to look.  But the Towers are 
impressive!  On the north side of the street you see a fellowship hall for
members of the Royal Order of Trackers and Rangers.</LongDescription>
