  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Eidenhoft Boulevard, west of the Fellowship Hall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Fellowship Hall is an odd religious society that is profound in 
believing that the world is going to end tomorrow.  Most religions say 
that the world will eventually end, say in two thousand years, give or 
take a few centuries, but the Fellowship is the only cult which believes
armageddon comes tomorrow, and are constantly annoyed that they wake up
each morning.</LongDescription>
