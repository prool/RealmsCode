  <ShortDescription>You are in the Swift Hand Thieves' Guild in southwestern Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This small building houses a small group of pickpockets who will gladly
fence just about anything you might want to get off your hands quickly
and without any questions.  The Swift Hand is a low level guild and 
does not offer too many services to the advanced thief, but caters to
the rogues of the land.</LongDescription>
