  <ShortDescription>You are on Taragon Road, just on the west side of the militia barracks.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Looking south, you can see the eastern village gate and the intersection
with Caledonia Way.  To the north are the village's storage barns and silos.
The surrounding farms keep Brownhaven well supplied with food, and in the
event of a long-term siege the village could probably hold out for several
years.  Of course, that's not likely, but its best to be prepared.</LongDescription>
