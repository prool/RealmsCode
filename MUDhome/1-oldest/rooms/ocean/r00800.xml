  <Name>Dark Staircase</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a dark staircase that apparently goes deep into the depths of
the Citadel.  The winding staircase takes you about three meters down.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You can easily make out the stairs with the light you have generated,
but the ground is very slippery.  It appears to be covered with moss
and other slime.  The ornate staircase reveals nothing about the upper
or lower realms you are venturing into except for the incredible detail
of which the staircase is crafted.  </LongDescription>
