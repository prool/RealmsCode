  <Name>The Sporting Pit</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the north side of a very large pit about fifty meters wide.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large pit you are in is used by the barbarians as their sporting 
arena.  Here, brave barbarians and other outsiders can challenge the
most powerful of the barbarian kin.  You are in the deeper of the two
pits, making it more likely that more barbarians will fall into this
pit than the one to the south.</LongDescription>
