  <ShortDescription>You are walking peacefully along Islandia Road, south of the Cathedral.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Cathedral of Worldly Bliss is one of the largest facilities of its
kind in Oceancrest, and perhaps much of the world.  Only the most powerful
and most worthy clerics are allowed inside, and very few are ever seen
wondering around in the first place.  Occasionally, the Cathedral will
hold festivities and other events for the public's benefit, but this is
usually just a front to collect more money from the poor.</LongDescription>
