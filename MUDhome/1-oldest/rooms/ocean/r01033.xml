  <ShortDescription>You are at the intersection of Rosecrest Street and Oceanview Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The wide and scenic Oceanview Drive continues to the north and south of this
intersection, while Rosecrest Street will take you through the business area
of the city.  Rosecrest Street changes direction a few times, and along here
it takes an east-west route.  It eventually runs north and south again, and
in fact it runs past the west side of Lyanden Castle at the northern end.</LongDescription>
