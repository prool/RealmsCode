  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Marina Way, which runs north and south through town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a large building to the east which appears to encompass an
entire city block.  There is a large, sparkling gem which appears to be
hovering over the building.  When radiated with the sun's rays, it gives
off a purplish hue which covers the entire building and some of the 
street.  Marina Way continues to the north and south.  The Central Arena
is to the south, past Rosecrest Street.</LongDescription>
