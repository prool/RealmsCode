  <ShortDescription>You are on Tranquility Way, east of the intersection with Leviathan Drive.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a wonderful old forest on both sides of the road, but the trees
on the south side of the road seem younger than those on the north.  Shadows
in the forest seem to move, but only out of the corner of your eye.</LongDescription>
