  <Name>Entrance to DeNail's Corn Fields</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the entrance to the DeNail Family Corn Fields labor office.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>DeNail is always willing to hire unskilled labor because he doesn't 
really have to pay them anything to clear out the crows and other pesty
creatures that eat up the corn.  The exit to the west leads out to 
Hafnia Way in the southwestern part of town.  The corn fields are pretty
large so you best watch out that you don't get lost.  </LongDescription>
