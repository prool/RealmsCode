  <ShortDescription>You are on the south side of the Dwarven Embassy, along Darmanian Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Embassy Court, located on the north side of the road, provides a voice
for the minority races in the huge city of Oceancrest.  Without this
sort of representation, the dwarves and elves might not get as much 
attention as they would like.  The Embassy is also a means to get in
touch with or find out information about other elven or dwarven cities.</LongDescription>
