  <ShortDescription>You are in the western hall of the palace of Keslar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The western hall runs along the west side of the large palace.  To 
the north is the large, glass-enclosed garden.  The mages accidentally
invented glass while testing high-energy fireballs on the sandy
shores of Eeste Island.  No one else seems to realize that it's just
sand.  Most of the humans still think it's just more of the mages' magic.</LongDescription>
