  <ShortDescription>You are in the front entry and foyer of the Kaldeas Mansion.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The room is opulent and rich, but dusty, as though it had not been used for
a very long time.  Mirrors hang at odd angles, and there are a number of
doors along the hallway.  Mardic Kaldeas was known as a master of illusion,
and everything you see behind those doors may not be exactly as they appear.</LongDescription>
