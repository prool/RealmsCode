  <ShortDescription>Appleton Road runs diagonally through the southern part of town.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>One of the few roads in Oceancrest that run diagonally through the town
is Appleton Road, which were created more or less for convinience before
the city planners decided to limit and prevent the further development of
skewed roads that deviated from the strict, grid-like pattern of the 
city's roads.</LongDescription>
