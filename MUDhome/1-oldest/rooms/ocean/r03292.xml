  <ShortDescription>You have entered Evan's magical potion shop, where you can buy many of your 
favorite potions for your adventures in and about the city of Kista.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Evan the Most Magnificent always thought he was a powerful mage, and
had intelligence to become one, had he not had such an ego.  His potions
are every bit as good as the ones you can buy in Oceancrest, but his
selection is poor.  Don't tell him that or you might get him mad.</LongDescription>
