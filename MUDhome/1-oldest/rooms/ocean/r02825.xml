  <ShortDescription>You are walking through a very ornate hallway covered with gold.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The fancy hallway comes to a corner here where it turns to the north and
to the east.  The gold which makes up the hallway's walls is not in the
least bit tarnished and the hallway appears to be kept very clean.  The
only odd part about the hall is the deathly silence.  There is almost no
activity to be heard in any direction.</LongDescription>
