  <LongDescription>You are in the great hallway which completely encircles the lowest level.
Prince Rutger had his builders create this castle in the form of concentric
levels, each one smaller than the one below it.  At the very top you will
find the private quarters of the Prince and his family.  This circular
hallway completely encircles the base level of the castle where troops are
garrisoned.  On the floor above you will find administrative offices.</LongDescription>
