  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Golden Dolphin Way, north of the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road, you can see a number of small houses used
by the farmers and their families.  Since the regular houses are so far
away from the farms, the farmer's federation demanded that special houses
be provided for the farmers.  This would increase productivity and make
everyone's lives much better.  And so it was done because the farmer's
lobby is one of the largest political lobby groups in the city, and holds
more power than even the government.</LongDescription>
