  <Name>Spider Island</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is a small island in the enchanted forest swamp which seems to be
covered with spider webs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Some of the webbing seems to be as thick as ropes!  What size spider makes
webs that large?  The only spiders you see as you look around are normal
water spiders, skating on the surface of the deep and dark swamp waters.
You can hack your way through the stuff, but do you really want to?</LongDescription>
