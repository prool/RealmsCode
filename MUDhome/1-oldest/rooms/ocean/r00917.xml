  <LongDescription>You can see all the intricate bows he as created and perfected.  The
elves take pride in their long history of bowmanship and perhaps make
the best bows known to exist.  It has been rumored that the elves also
made the magical flame bow, but it was so long ago, no one really 
remembers.  There is a famous elven bowyer who lives in the Enchanted
Forest.  His name is Llanandar.  He might remember if the story is true.</LongDescription>
