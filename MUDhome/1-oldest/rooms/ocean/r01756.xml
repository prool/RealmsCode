  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Kafkan Way, running parallel to the City Walls.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road, you can see the Highland Stables, where
visitors may leave their horses while staying in Oceancrest.  It is very
hazardous to be riding a horse in Oceancrest, both for the horse and for
the pedestrians walking the streets.  Furthermore, it's almost impossible
to find a place to leave your horse when you go into a shop.  Therefore,
the city asks that people leave their steeds at one of the many stables
in town.</LongDescription>
