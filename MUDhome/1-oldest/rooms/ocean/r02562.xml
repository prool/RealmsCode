  <ShortDescription>You are in the office of the mayor of Kista, a consumate politician.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mayor isn't really dishonest, but there really isn't much for him
to do.  The real leaders of the city are in the Tower and Mayor Kreech
simply takes his orders from them.  He does, however, have to run for 
re-election every few years, and tries to satisfy his most important
backers.  He's not above taking a bribe or two.  Do you have any money?</LongDescription>
