  <ShortDescription>This was once the luxurous quarters of Rothchild the mage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>His fate was sealed when he came face to face with the Witch of Kayleigh,
and she turned him into living stone.  Only the most powerful of magic can
cancel that spell, and none today know the spell.  It may have been lost
forever when the books and other treasures in this room were burned.</LongDescription>
