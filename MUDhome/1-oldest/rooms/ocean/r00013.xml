  <Name>Goldenrod Avenue/Brownhaven Way</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at the end of Brownhaven Way, where it meets Goldenrod Avenue. </ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Goldenrod Avenue is actually a narrow, winding little lane to the west, but
seems to be a little wider as you look east.  An imposing building is at
the southeast corner of this intersection.  A fairly new sign says its the
tax collector's office.  Across the street on the southwestern corner is
the village militia's headquarters.</LongDescription>
