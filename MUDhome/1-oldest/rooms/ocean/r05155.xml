  <Name>Western Hallway of Castle Kayleigh</Name>
  <ShortDescription>The hallway is quiet, as with long ago death.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Nothing has been in this section of the castle since that intense battle
long ago.  Now it is simply a forlorn place for old ghosts.  To the east
is the center courtyard, while to the west is the interior of the castle's
outer wall.</LongDescription>
