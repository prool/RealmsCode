  <ShortDescription>You are in a shop which caters to magicians, wizards and mages for armor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Metal shields and armor interfere with the casting of magic spells, making
it difficult for masters of the occult to find decent armor.  The House of
Hides prides itself on being able to produce leather armor and leather
shields which are almost the equal of the best metal armor.  Such equipment
is not cheap, however, and because the leather is strengthened with magic
it cannot be repaired by the various repair shops around town.</LongDescription>
