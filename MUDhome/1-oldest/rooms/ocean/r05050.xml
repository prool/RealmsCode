  <ShortDescription>You are near the southern section of Brownhaven.  50.n0.e0.s1.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A rocky tor, part of the Nartiz Mountain Range, juts north toward the
village of Brownhaven.  You will have to climb higher to stay above the
hot, sharp rocks you see below.  Not much vegetation down there, and you
see very little animal life.  To the east however, you can see the great
Kista Forest, which is south of the beautiful city of Kista.</LongDescription>
