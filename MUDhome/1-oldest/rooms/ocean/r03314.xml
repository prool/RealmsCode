  <ShortDescription>You are on a gravel path between the main gate and a foutain to the south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A light mist has slowly crept up and surrounded you and the path you
are on.  Trying to lose it seems futile, as it clings to you and follows
every step you take.  At this point it has become difficult to see any
further than the edge of the path.  The main gate is to the north, and
the Necropolis Fountain is south.</LongDescription>
