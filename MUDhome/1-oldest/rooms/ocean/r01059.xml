  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Eidenhoft Boulevard, northeast of the intersection
between Eidenhoft, Rosecrest Street and Waterfront Way.   A park is east.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Because of Eidenhoft Boulevard's diagonal nature, small portions of the
city block became unusable, notably the sections directly to the south
and east of here.  To make the area more aesthetically pleasing, the 
slivers of land were converted to small parks.  There is a large 
intersection to the southwest where three roads come together.</LongDescription>
