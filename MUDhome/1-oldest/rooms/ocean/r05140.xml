  <ShortDescription>You are in a very large kitchen designed to feed hundreds of people.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Although the rest of the castle is in total ruin, this kitchen appears
untouched.  There is no damage in here at all.  Some smoke across the high
ceiling is about all there is.  Pots, pans and other cooking equipment are
still ready to be used.  A dumbwaiter shaft on the south wall is open.</LongDescription>
