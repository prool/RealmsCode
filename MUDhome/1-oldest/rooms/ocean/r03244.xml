  <Name>Lake Kista East Shore</Name>
  <ShortDescription>This is the east side of Lake Kista, a pristine body of water.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>An odd ripple on the surface of the water seems to be centered just off
shore, and periodically repeats itself.  Must be something down there
causing it.  It looks like it was a good idea to not go into the water,
in spite of the rumors that the lake has healing powers.</LongDescription>
