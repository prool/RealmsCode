  <ShortDescription>You are at the main entrance of the Grandest Cathedral in the Land of Mordor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>At the end of the stations to the north is the chambers of the Oracle.
She is jealously guarded by the monks who maintain this shrine to long
forgotten gods of the mountains, as she is the only one of the gods who 
still listens to them.  If you wish to ask her a question, you must go to
the first of the stations.  She takes the form of an owl, and if she likes
your question, you may see her at the next station.</LongDescription>
