  <LongDescription>You are in the Wizard's Eye, in a room flooded with emerald green light.
A wizard, wearing a red robe and a green sash stands near the entrance to
the training room door.  He offers you the key to the door, but also has
his hand out.  Perhaps you should talk to him.</LongDescription>
