  <ShortDescription>You are inside a hollow part of a giant redwood tree.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>there is hole leading out onto a large branch nearby, and ladder rungs are
nailed to the inside of the huge trunk.  They disappear into the dark as
you look both up and down.  Outside, you can see a staircase attached to the
side of the tree, and it seems to spiral out of sight also.  But at least
its not dark out there.</LongDescription>
