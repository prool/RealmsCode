  <LongDescription>To the west is the end of the avenue.  From here its possible to see the
intersection with East Ulandia, which runs north and south through the
village.  Further west you can see the banks of the rives which separates
the two parts of the village.  The eastern part of the village is mostly
used for low-rent housing and huge warehouses.  The militia also keeps
equipment here.</LongDescription>
