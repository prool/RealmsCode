  <ShortDescription>You are in the plush vestibule of the luxurious Dragon Tooth Inn.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dragon Tooth Inn has quite a history in the city of Oceancrest.
At one time there was a hidden meeting room in the back part of the inn,
and a group of anti-royalist terrorists met there.   After a number of
visiting Viscounts were murdered in their locked rooms, the inn was closed
and the owner hanged.  Now the inn is open again, under new management.</LongDescription>
