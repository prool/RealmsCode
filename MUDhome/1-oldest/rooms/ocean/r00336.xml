  <ShortDescription>You are west of the main part of the village on Uland Way.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The way is muddy and not very wide, making it difficult to travel along
here.  A couple of shops are open, but there is also one that has a for
sale sign on the door.  As you look closer you see in small letters that
the previous owner died of the red death, and that the widow is willing 
to sell cheap.  On the south side is Herman's Blacksmith Shop.</LongDescription>
