  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Khelleva Drive, west of the Khelleva Mansion.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Main Entrance to the Khelleva Mansion is located to the east.  The
large estate is made almost completely of carved marble and concrete,
making the Mansion an almost invulnerable fortress.  The large marble
statues and other trinkets decorate the entrance hall, almost dwarfing
the tallest half-giants.  The stable entrance is located to the south.</LongDescription>
