  <ShortDescription>You are on a trail through the botanical gardens of the Enchanted Forest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The trail starts to get steep as it goes eastward towards the foothills.
On both sides of the trail are wierd looking plants which move constantly.
You recognize some of these plants, but they have been terrribly changed
by something.  What was once a beautiful snapdragon has become a rather
awful looking chomp dragon.  With teeth.</LongDescription>
