  <ShortDescription>You are on Kista Avenue, at the west side of the Cathedral of Veratus.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Alturis Road is directly south, giving you a good view of the great Hanging
Gardens.  There is an apothecary shoppe on the corner just opposite the
Cathedral.  They charge high prices, but it all goes for a good cause since
it is used to support the building fund for the Cathedral.</LongDescription>
