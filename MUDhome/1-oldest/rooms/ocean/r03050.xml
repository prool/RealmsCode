  <Name>Goblin Underground Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a passageway lead to the western section of the goblin shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Unlike most of the other passageways and tunnels down here, there are a
few smoky torches occasionly along the way.  certainly not enough to see
by, but perhaps enough to serve as landmarks.  This section of tunnels is
different in another way, too.  The walls are smooth, and feel warm to the
touch.</LongDescription>
