  <ShortDescription>You are on the eastern side of a stone bridge spanning the Ashton River.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Cattails and pussywillows grow in the water below the bridge's footing,
and a small boat is tied to an iron ring set in the stone.  The bridge
crosses to the west, and the road on this side continues to the north
alongside the river's bank.  Frogs and small birds can be seen all along
water's edge.  The east side of the road is thick with trees.</LongDescription>
