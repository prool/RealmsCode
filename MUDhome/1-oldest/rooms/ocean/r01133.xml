  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street, heading in an east to west direction.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north of Rosecrest Street is a rowdy-looking bar and grill called the
Golden Dragon Cantina.  It looks like a popular hangout for the people who
work for a living.  You see many of the people who hold administrative jobs
within the city entering and leaving the bar.  Rosecrest Street continues to
the east towards Oceanview Drive and west towards the City Wall.</LongDescription>
