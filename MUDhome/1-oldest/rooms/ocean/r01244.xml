  <ShortDescription>You are walking around the western edge of the Allisk Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are walking along the western rim of the Allisk Circle.  Oddly, the
center of the circle is not very well kept up and is covered with dead
grass and wilting weeds.  Hillcrest Drive continues to the west from
here.  There is a strange-looking gazebo towards the southwest.  The
circle continues to the northeast and southeast.</LongDescription>
