  <ShortDescription>You are in an intersecting plane between this world and another.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Vlassen sits on pillows, a small boy with a smooth face and a tender
young body.  His eyes follow you, and appear to be ancient pools of
darkness as they peer into your soul.  He slowly twists a heavy strand
of knotted human hair in his small hands as he waits for you to speak.
The elderly men mutter and glare as they also wait.  Do not anger them
further, as they are powerful in spite of their appearances.</LongDescription>
