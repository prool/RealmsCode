  <ShortDescription>You are swimming strongly in the Respitial Sea near a boat and a raft.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A decrepit old boat swings at anchor nearby and you can see a friendly
wave from a person standing near the rail.  Not far from the boat is a
large raft, also anchored.  The raft appears to be quite comfortable
and has a canvas sunshade over most of its deck.  There doesn't seem
to be anyone aboard the raft.</LongDescription>
