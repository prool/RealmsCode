  <ShortDescription>Rare herbs and spices are always a commodity in Oceancrest.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Some spices are said to have magical or mystical powers associated with
them.  Most, however, are just used for seasonings or to preserve meats.
There are shelves upon shelves of herbs and spices along the walls, most
of which you've never seen before.</LongDescription>
