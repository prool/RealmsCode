  <LongDescription>The village of Brownhaven has often been noted for the famous people who
have come here to retire.  Great mages, fighters and clerics live on the
southwest side of the little town, giving parties for one another and 
discussing the old days.  Not much time is devoted to local politics,
but there is a thriving political machine here.  That is, when the mayor
isn't drunk.</LongDescription>
