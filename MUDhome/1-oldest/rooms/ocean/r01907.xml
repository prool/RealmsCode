  <ShortDescription>You are in an ugly-looking arena with scattered bones lying about.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Monsters seldom pick up after themselves, and the guards don't like
to even enter this dangerous arena.  Those who die here are left to be
digested by the monsters that ate them.  The Gladiator Pits are to the
east and the One-on-One combat arena is to the north.  Only one person
can be in that arena at once.  The monsters are starting to smell some
fresh meat so you had better be on your guard.</LongDescription>
