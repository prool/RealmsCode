  <ShortDescription>You are walking along the southern edge of the Allisk Circle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>As you walk around the Allisk Circle, you notice that the center is unlike
most of the other "traffic circles" you have encountered.  The center is
almost devoid of all life.  It is covered in dead grass and wilting weeds.
Regalia Way, not to be confused with Regalia Drive, runs southwest from
here.  Lankshire Parkway continues to the south out of the Circle.</LongDescription>
