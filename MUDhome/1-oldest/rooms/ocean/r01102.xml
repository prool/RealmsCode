  <ShortDescription>You are on Nagaritha Drive, south of the Oceancrest Amphitheatre.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large Amphitheatre extends for the entire city block, and provides
enough access so that no one in the city is ever really denied entrance
to the public location.  On the south side of Nagaritha Drive is a large
door which sports the words "Dangerous Destinations" above it in bright
red letters.  A small plaque beside the door says "Guide to the Universe".</LongDescription>
