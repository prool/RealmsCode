  <ShortDescription>You are in the front room of the Oceancrest Orphanage.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This orphanage is supported by the dwarven populace of Oceancrest as a
haven for children of all races.  The dwarves, as part of their reverence
for Moradin, administer and support this home for kids.  Unfortunately,
the kids are so destructive, the place is in constant need of repair, and
many of the rooms are overcrowded.  But oddly, even though there is a lot
of spare room in the cellar, the kids refuse to go down there.</LongDescription>
