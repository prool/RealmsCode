  <ShortDescription>Appleton Road runs diagonally between the Cattle Ranch and Slaughterhouse.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Circle-Bar Cattle Ranch furnishes Oceancrest with much of the fresh,
domesticated meat to its citizens.  The cattle are born and raised on the
Ranch and then herded to the Slaughterhouse, located on the west side
of the road.  The Circle-Bar Ranch gladly accepts help from any outsiders
that might want to help slaughtering the cows as most people pass out from
all the blood and stench.</LongDescription>
