  <Name>Gypsy Pawn Shop</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a darkened little pawn shop run by a family of gypsies.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The gypsies are relatively quiet people, but need to make their money 
somehow.  They offer to tell you your future for a share of your gold.
Although most of the things they might tell you are the same thing you'd
get out of a fortune cookie, your future might be in for a few surprises.</LongDescription>
