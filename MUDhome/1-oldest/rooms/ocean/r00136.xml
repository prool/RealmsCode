  <ShortDescription>You are on Caledonia Road, just south of the annual Brownhaven Fair.  On
the north side of the road there are a lot of tents and booths set up to
form an open-air market place.  Near the entrance, you can see a group of
acrobats practicing their moves.  On the south side of the road is an old
building with a faded sign.  "Jeremia's maps and information."</ShortDescription>
