  <ShortDescription>You are in a bright orange field of poppies, waving in the breeze.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is the second level, but you can get down to the first level by
going east from here.  The third level is actually a tower you see to the
west, more or less in the center of the entire Garden.  The tower seems to
be covered with honeysuckle and other climbing vines.  Pixies use the gum
from the poppies to make a fine dust for parties.</LongDescription>
