  <ShortDescription>You are walking between the Holy Orders of the White Cross and Black Cross.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This is not necessarily a good place to be.  The great holy warriors of
Oceancrest built these two facilities to further train and challenge
themselves.  It was eventually discovered that there must be evil in
everything that is also good, but in order to truly be good, you must
in fact face evil and be able to walk away from it.</LongDescription>
