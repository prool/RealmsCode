  <ShortDescription>You are at the junction of two paths leading into the center of the Pits.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Tow paths lead around the center of the Barbarian Pits to the northeast and
southwest.  Heading to the west takes you to the only entrance of the Pits.
Directly east, you can see the Barbarian Chief's Hut, although you will have
to take a less direct route to get there.  On the south side of the path is
an area for the village's young to play.</LongDescription>
