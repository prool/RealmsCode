  <ShortDescription>You are at a small interesection in the vast caverns below the glacier.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The further north you head, the deeper into the ground you appear to be
heading.  Looking up, you can still see the massive glacier over your
head and the sky above the ice, which gets darker and darker the further
down you go.  The cavern splits in two directions here, one going east
and the other going west.  The cavern heads back towards the Dennanl Abyss
to the south.</LongDescription>
