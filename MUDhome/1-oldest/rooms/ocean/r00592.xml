  <ShortDescription>You are on Rosecrest Street between the Sleepy Traveler Inn and the Stables.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Evenborough Stables are provided for visitors to leave their horses
while visiting Oceancrest.  Sharing the streets with horses and pedestrians
can be quite dangerous, both to the horse and the people on the street.
All visitors are therefore requested to leave their steeds in the capable
hands of the stable managers.</LongDescription>
