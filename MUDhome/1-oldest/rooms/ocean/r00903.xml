  <ShortDescription>You assume you are somewhere under the city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You've deduced that you must now be under the cemetery.  It's quite
dark in here.  All the torches have burned out.  You notice that the
floor is covered in sickly green moss, making it quite slippery.  The
smell in here is also pretty atrocious.</LongDescription>
