  <ShortDescription>You are travelling down Monument Avenue, just south of the Shrine of Moradin.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the north side of the road, you can see the Dwarven Shrine of Moradin,
the creator of the Dwarven Race.  All dwarves worship Moradin as if the
world is going to end tomorrow.  Such dedication and faith has in the 
past given dwarves the extra moral boost they need to defeat nearly 
impossible odds.  On the southern side of the road is the Obidian 
Community Housing Complex, where most of the city's citizens, who want to
live in the city, live.</LongDescription>
