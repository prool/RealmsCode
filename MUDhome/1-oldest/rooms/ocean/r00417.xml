  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Lorian Parkway, west of Handel's House of Fire.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Fire itself is not very rare in Oceancrest, but getting something to start
a fire isn't always as easy as one would like.  Handel's House of Fire 
provides for these needs, as well as the possibility of having to put them
out.  On the west side of the road is Xanthar's Holy Supplies, where a
variety of clerical items may be purchased.</LongDescription>
