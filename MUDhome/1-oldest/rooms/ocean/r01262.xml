  <Name>Crypt Intersection</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a large cave in the crypt which splits off in all directions.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The crypt does not look very big, but with the number of intersections
and dead-end paths, it's very easy to get lost.  The great mages also
knew people would try to invade their tomb to retrieve lost artifacts
and have made a number of traps to prevent this.</LongDescription>
