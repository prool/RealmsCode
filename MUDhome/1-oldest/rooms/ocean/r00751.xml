  <ShortDescription>You are on Wakeforest Drive, between the Shrine of Creation on the east
side of the road and the Holy Order of the Red Rose on the west side.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Holy Order of the Red Rose is one of the Paladin's training centers
in Oceancrest.  This center is designed to train intermediate level
Paladins before they enter the services of Lyanden Castle.  The Shrine
of Creation is a monument to life in general, although no one can really
figure out who built it or why.  Many people, however, still frequent the
small shrine, hoping for a miracle of some sort.</LongDescription>
