  <ShortDescription>You are on Oceanview Drive, just south of a very large and busy intersection.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the north is the intersection of Oceanview Drive, Nagaritha Drive and
Eidenhoft Boulevard.  The intersection is extremely busy but most people
don't stop to talk there.  To the east is a fairly new shopping complex.
By contrast, the sign above the shop on this side of the road is pretty
old and faded.  It reads, "Bysantal's General Goods and Services."</LongDescription>
