  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, west of the Allakaren Pyramid.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Allakaren Pyramid was built centuries ago before the city of Oceancrest
even existed.  However, after many years of looting and wear by the 
elements, the Pyramid has started to deteriorate.  After the City of 
Oceancrest was formed and the walls around the city were being planned,
the administrators decided that it would be in the best interests of
the community to protect the Pyramid within the City Walls.  It is said
that the Pyramid is still haunted by its previous owner, but this hasn't
stopped archeologists from digging around inside.</LongDescription>
