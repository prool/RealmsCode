  <ShortDescription>You are in a paneled room, at the second station of Veratus, the Oracle.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This Grand Cathedral was once the home of several gods from the mountains,
but they decided they liked the mountains better than staying here around a
bunch of monks who always kept their eyes covered.  The monks believed the
gods wanted them to do that, but there was a real lack of communication.
Veratus can be found here if she liked your first question.</LongDescription>
