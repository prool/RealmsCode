  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Leviathan Drive, east of the famous Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The strange Avatar Ruins were formed mysteriously by avatars of the gods
fighting raging battles with each other over superiority.  Avatars, being
the physical representation of the gods on this world, had powers beyond
those even dreamed of by anyone, and caused more destruction than any war
had ever done.</LongDescription>
