  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Nagaritha Drive, north of the DeNail Corn Fields.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The DeNail Corn Fields are a prime source of income for many of the less
able people of Oceancrest.  DeNail is very lenient and lets just about
anyone work there if they cannot find other suitable work.  Of course 
that means that he doesn't have to pay them very much either.  The
entrance to the fields is located off of Hafnia Way, to the west.</LongDescription>
