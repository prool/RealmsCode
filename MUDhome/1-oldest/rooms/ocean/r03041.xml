  <Name>Goblin Underground Passage</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are at an underground intersection somewhere in the goblin shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The passage is devoid of all light, except for the torches and lanterns
you carry.  The walls around you are cold and dry to the touch.  Through
the arch you see flashes of light and hear mortal shrieks of pain. </LongDescription>
