  <ShortDescription>You are traveling on the North Highway, near a line of trees.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The highway tends to meander as it cuts across fields and meadows, choosing
the easiest way to go.  From time to time you see carts and waving peasants
either going or coming from Oceancrest.  Not far to the north there is a
traveler's inn where you might spend the night.</LongDescription>
