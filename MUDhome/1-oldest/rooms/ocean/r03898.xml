  <ShortDescription>You are in a small chamber deep under the Ulandian Temple.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The temple worshipers considered puzzles to be sacred, and took great pride
in creating labyrinths and mysteries.  This room doesn't appear to have any
exits, but the fact that you are here means there must be at least the one
you came in.  Sometimes, the most obvious is quite invisible.  There is a 
hole far over your head, but it would be impossible to go that way.</LongDescription>
