  <ShortDescription>You are in the main audience chamber of the elven shrine.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>To the east you see a great golden statue of Larethian surrounded by an
immense ebony and silver altar.  Below the statue is a reflecting pool
of an amber liquid, and beside the exquisitely carved statue there are
banks of sweet smelling candles.  Looking north you see the wedding
chapel.  An elegantly thick carpet covers the floor, and velvet drapes 
hang on the walls, producing a very quiet ambience.</LongDescription>
