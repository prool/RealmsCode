  <ShortDescription>You are on Golden Dolphin Way, south of the numerous silos lining the street.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a total of three silos on this side of the road, and one
grainery to the north of those.  The large silos store enough corn and
wheat to maintain the city for more than six months without replenishing.
Excess wheat and corn can then be exported out of the city to less
fortunate cities that are not so self-sufficient.</LongDescription>
