  <LongDescription>Often considered one of the most powerful mages of modern time, Mistress
Danielle Chanteclaire reached the status of Arch-Mage faster than any
known previous spellcaster.  Her powers are most likely stronger than
the Keslar Mages, but they have never had a reason to test their spell-
casting abilities on each other.</LongDescription>
