  <ShortDescription>You are in a deep and dark tunnel beneath the Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walls are smooth and dry, with not a cobweb to be found.  Beneath your
feet is some of the rarest rose marble in the land of Mordor.  Only your
own movements can be heard in this silent tunnel.  The still air has a dry,
stale quality to it, and you lick your lips to keep them from cracking.
The tunnel continues to the north and south.</LongDescription>
