  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Riverdell Way, next to the Archery Range and City Wall.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Dentra Archery Range is located on the east side of the road.  On the
east side of the road is the City Wall, marking the city's border on the
east side.  The City Wall does not travel in a straight line at this corner
of the city, though.  It will head east again in order to enclose the 
Pyramid of Allakaren.</LongDescription>
