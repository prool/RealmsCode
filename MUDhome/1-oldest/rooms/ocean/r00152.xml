  <ShortDescription>Poor Alley twists and turns as it runs north to south.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This place doesn't smell very good, and you are constantly being pulled
at by grubby and dirty hands.  Beggers plead for money, and sneakthieves
look you over to see where you purse might be.  If you had a serious
fight here, there's not much room, and who knows how many of them might
decide to gang together against you?  There seems to be some action to
the west.</LongDescription>
