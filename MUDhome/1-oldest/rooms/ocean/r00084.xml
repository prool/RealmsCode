  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road continues to the east and west.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Off in the distance to the northeast you can see a large building of some
sort.  You can barely hear yells and screams from inside -- sounds like
an arena.  On the south side is a small shop with three brass balls hanging
over the door.</LongDescription>
