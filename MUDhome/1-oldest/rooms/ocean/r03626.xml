  <ShortDescription>You are on a walkway reserved for the Prince and his administration.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The walkway leads to the reviewing stand to the north and the center to
the Lyanden Statue in the south.  When the troops are assembled for
inspection and the Prince comes from the eastern arch, this walkway is
cordoned off and guards are stationed shoulder-to-shoulder along here.
The walkway is at least 30 meters across, and is open to the sky above.
As you look up you marvel at the heights of the towers rising into the
clouds above.  On the east side one tower in particular stands alone.</LongDescription>
