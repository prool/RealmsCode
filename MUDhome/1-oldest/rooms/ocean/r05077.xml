  <ShortDescription>The deep blue lake nestles in the Kista forest.  40.n0.e25.s8.w0</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>You are near the western shore of the lake, where you can see a pier and
several boats.  The pines, cedar and oaks come almost to the water's edge.
The pier seems to have some activity, and a small number of cabins are near
its end.  South is a dark storm.</LongDescription>
