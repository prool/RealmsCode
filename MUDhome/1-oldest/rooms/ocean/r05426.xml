  <ShortDescription>You are midway across the Phexton Bridge spanning Ashton Gorge.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Ashton River tumbles over a ledge high overhead to the east, and falls
to the bottom of the gorge, providing you with a breathtaking view of the
great falls.  Looking to the northeast you see the road splits and one part
leads north around the mountain cliff, while another disappears under the
the great wall of water.</LongDescription>
