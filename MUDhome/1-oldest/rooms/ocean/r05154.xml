  <ShortDescription>This is the western concourse of the Castle of Kayleigh.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A few centuries ago, when this was a thriving and happy castle, this was
the main concourse leading to the drawbridge at the front of the castle.
The hall is wide enough that servants of the castle used it to bring wagons 
this way for deliveries to the kitchen.</LongDescription>
