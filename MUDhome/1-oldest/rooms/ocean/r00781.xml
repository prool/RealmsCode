  <Name>Orange Jacinith Hall</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are in a sparkling orange hallway composed completely of jacinith
stones.  The hallway seems to continue on forever in both directions. 
Close examination in both directions reveals an iron gate on both sides,
identical to the one you went through originally, but two of them?</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>In an almost symetrical hallway, you see both to the east and west a 
crystal intersection.  The intersection to the east appears to be a little
closer than the west one, but it's hard to tell.  Careful examination 
of the west wall reveals a large crystal that reflects light around a 
bend to the south.</LongDescription>
