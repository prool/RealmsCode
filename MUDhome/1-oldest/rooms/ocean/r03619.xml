  <ShortDescription>You are on the western side of the main courtyard in Castle Ragnar.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There are a small group of tents here, each a different color and size.
this is a favorite spot for the money lenders and money changers to
gather.  Travelers from far places often prefer to get their money 
changed to the local currency to avoid looking like what they are, 
tourists, and thus being charged higher than normal prices.  This is
a good place to trade-in your foreign bills for Oceancrest gold.</LongDescription>
