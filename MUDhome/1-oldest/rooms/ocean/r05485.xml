  <LongDescription>Tillie will buy anything if she thinks she can turn a profit on it.
Although she retired long ago, buying cheap and selling dear is in her
blood, and she enjoys the exchange even though she doesn't need the money.
A family picture on the wall shows Tillie with her two brothers, Toby and
Trabin.  It must have been taken a very long time ago.</LongDescription>
