  <Name>The Widow Maker Aft Deck</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are on the starboard side of the aft deck of the pirate ship Widow Maker.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The large aft deck supports the command center of the ship, and it is
very likely that you will encounter much resistance as you walk around
this forbidden area.  Even most of the crew is not allowed up onto the
aft deck unless there is an emergency.</LongDescription>
