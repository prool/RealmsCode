  <ShortDescription>You are walking in the Main Hallway, just east of the Main Chapel.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The hallway opens into a large chapel to the west where anyone may 
enter to pray, study or just rest under the watchful eye of Artemis.
There is a door to the north which reads "Priestess' Quarters".  
There is another door on the south which reads "Meditation Chamber".
The chapel is relatively deserted at this time, but shows a bit of
movement occasionally.</LongDescription>
