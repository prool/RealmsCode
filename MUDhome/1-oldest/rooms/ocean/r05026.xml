  <ShortDescription>You are riding a dragon at the south slope of Mount Aphinix.  50.n3.e0.so.w3</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The mountain is considered to be the domain of a clan of blood thirsty
trolls, and the dragons have been trained to not fly there, lest it anger
the trolls and another long war erupts between the people of Brownhaven and
the mountain trolls.  To the west is the Nartiz Mountain Range, just over 
some low hills.  South of you is the Vallenda Pass, which connects Gotland
Glenn with the Vallenda Plains.</LongDescription>
