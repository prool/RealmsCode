  <Name>Road Guard Barracks</Name>
  <ShortDescription>You are inside the barracks reserved for the guards who man the road kiosk.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A warm fire and beds with wool blankets look very inviting.  A hot soup is
simmering over the fire in a black cauldron, and you see a crusty bread on
the table, with a huge round of cheese.  An ale keg stands at the end of
the table.  Apparently, this barracks is also a post office.</LongDescription>
