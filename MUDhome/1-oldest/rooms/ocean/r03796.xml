  <ShortDescription>You are on top of a high cliff in the Lelion Beach and Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The top of the cliffs is very flat, forming a high table running east and
west.  From here you can see that most of the Nylandian Bay is located to
the southwest.  Looking north you see the Lithium Inlet where fresh water
from the Ashton River pours into the bay.  Across the inlet there are a
group of shops and several streets in the northwest part of Oceancrest.
The cliff tops slope gradually down to the east, and you see a number of
colorful tents in that direction.  A path goes down to the south.</LongDescription>
