  <ShortDescription>You are in a northern block of the crystalline city.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>This section of the city is simply alive with bustling activity, and a crowd
of crystallines have gathered to watch a fight taking place in the middle of
the way.  The crystallines simply ignore you.  On both sides of the street
are shops and stands where you can apparently buy almost anything.</LongDescription>
