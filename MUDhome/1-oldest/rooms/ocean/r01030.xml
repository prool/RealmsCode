  <LongDescription>Netherworld Lane heads east from this point and proceeds all the way
to the east side of town.  The road gets its name by passing on the
north side of the Necropolis, towards the center of town.  Oceanview
Drive is a more scenic route with less traffic for those who want to
enjoy the many pleasures the city has to offer.</LongDescription>
