  <ShortDescription>You are on an observation deck a few meters above the training room floor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>A few of the very important visitors to the Wizard's Eye are occasionally
allowed to stand here to watch the training that takes place on the floor
below.  However, no mage under level twelve may fly from this point to the
training room.  Down below you see a very high level red-robed sorceress
who is congratulating young mages who have left their mentor's rooms to
receive the final instructions.</LongDescription>
