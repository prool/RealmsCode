  <ShortDescription>You are clinging to the left platform, high above the tigers in the Carnival.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Sitting high above the tigers, the view from here is extraordinary.  You
can see just about everywhere, although everything looks so small.  The
only exits are back to the highwire and, heaven forbid, down.  It looks
like you could just about miss the cage directly below if you jumped out
far enough.</LongDescription>
