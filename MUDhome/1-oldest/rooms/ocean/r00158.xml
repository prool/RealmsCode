  <ShortDescription>Plasnelt Road was named after a geological area to the north of the village.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The village of Brownhaven sits at the western end of Gotland Glenn, near
the eastern edge of the Nartiz Mountain Range.  It's a rather idealic spot,
but its proximity to Mount Aphinix means its sometimes subject to raids
by mountain trolls.   On the north side of the road there is a repair shop.</LongDescription>
