  <ShortDescription>You are on the western shore of the salt water underground lake Plasnelt.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The salty water suggests that there might be a way out into the ocean
from here, but it'd be hard to find without some serious help.  The
lake is very deep.  Occasionally, you hear gurgling noises coming from
the center of the lake.</LongDescription>
