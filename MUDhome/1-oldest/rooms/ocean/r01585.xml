  <ShortDescription>You are in the inner circle of the druid dwelling known as Etolos.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>With the exception of a few guards passing you by, you notice that the
center of the druid community is quite tranquil.  There was much more
activity in the outer circles; however, you notice that there are a lot
more higher level, more powerful druids roaming around.  Most are just
meditating, and quite obviously would not enjoy being disturbed.</LongDescription>
