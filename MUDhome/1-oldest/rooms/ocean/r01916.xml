  <ShortDescription>You are walking on Oceancrest Avenue south of the Ashton Falls Resort.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>It's very expensive to live in the Ashton Falls Resort, but many of the
higher level people in Oceancrest consider it worth it.  The gardens
inside are said to rival any in the world, and the living spaces are
secluded and very private.  The main entrance is further to the east,
and a quaint little shopping center is a little way to the west.</LongDescription>
