  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Overland Drive, south of the Allisk Manor.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>Natasha de Allisk came to Oceancrest many centuries ago, and was at the
time rumored to be a vampire.  This was soon proved to be true as many
children and women mysteriously disappeared and were found on the Allisk
Estate.  Unfortunately, Natasha had "died" and no one could do anything
about it.  It was later figured out that she was in fact a vampire and
was merely hibernating once her cover was blown.  No one has since tried
to enter the Manor and Natasha has not been seen for ages.</LongDescription>
