  <ShortDescription>You are at the eastern edge of Uland Island, looking over the bluffs.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The Respitial Sea stretches out before you to the east.  The coast of
Mordor lies in that direction, and the great city of Oceancrest has a
seaport there.  The bluffs look impossible to scale, but down below is
a glistningly white beach.  The rutted road which leads east also turns
and makes its way for a short distance to the north, but it soon disappears
because of little use and fast growing jungle.</LongDescription>
