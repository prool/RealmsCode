  <ShortDescription>You are walking along Highland Avenue, east of the Wakarimasu Park.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>The massive park on the west side of the road is very beautiful, inspired
by ancient eastern structures from the other side of the continent that
few people ever get the chance to see.  The massive park boasts a number
of shrines to ancient gods and goddesses no longer believed to exist.</LongDescription>
