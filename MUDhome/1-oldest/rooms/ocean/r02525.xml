  <ShortDescription>You are on Teal Avenue which turns to the southeast to avoid a grassy hill.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>There is a fenced hill to the south, and the avenue jogs to the east to
avoid it.  Looks like it might be the overflow seating for the amphitheater 
located west of here.  Small factories are on the east side of the street.</LongDescription>
