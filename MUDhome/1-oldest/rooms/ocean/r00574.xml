  <ShortDescription>You are traveling along Leviathan Drive, just east of the Avatar Ruins.</ShortDescription>
  <LongDescription>On the east side of the road, you can see a large park formed between
Leviathan on the west and Orchard on the north.  The park, or more
appropriately, forest, seems to be deserted.  Not even animals are
wandering around in the patch of trees and birds fly completely around
the square of land all together.</LongDescription>
