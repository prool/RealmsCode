Monster Yelling

Yelling is a technique used by mobs to call for help when in
battle. If you've ever seen the doctors call for the aid of
the Highport guardsmen, you know what I'm talking about.
There are a few things to make a monster yell:

1) Set mflag 120. If you don't want the players to know the
   monster has called for help, set flag 122. It's fairly
   simple.
 Can see yelling:
     The doctor yells for help!
     : A doctor just arrived.
     The doctor quickly assists the doctor!
     The doctor attacks you.

 Cannot see yelling:
     : A Highport guardsman just arrived.
     The Highport guardsman runs to the aid of the doctor!
     The Highport guardsman almost BASHED you.

2) Next, when you *sta a monster, it will read:
     Rescue mobs:   None. (*set p1 and p2 to the mob numbers)
   You can set two mobs, and the more slots filled up the more
   likely it is for someone to arrive. So, set p1 and p2 to the
   rescue mobs' number.

3) Set the traffic accordingly. The higher the traffic in the room,
   the more likely it is that someone will come to the mobs'
   assistance. Default traffic for yelling is 15%, even if the room's
   traffic is 0.

NOTE: _NEVER_ set mflag 121. The mud will do this for you. If you do,
it'll mess a lot of stuff up. Just don't do it.

Guidelines: Mobs which are stunned or circled can yell for help as
well as those which are being hit. If you want to see it work, *mon
34 and attack Baron von Hanna. Also, keep in mind that when a
yelling mob's rescue mob arrives, the yelling mob is automatically
set to "will-be-assisted." So if you have other mobs hanging out in
the room, they will attack the players if they have the "will-assist"
mflag set.
