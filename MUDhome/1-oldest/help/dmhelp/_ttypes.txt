Ex: A level 1 wino with ttype 2 will have a max
    of: 6sp, 3cp.
    A level 20 dragonman (mtype dragon) with 
    ttype 11 will have a max of: 
    8ap, 14pp, 36gp, 1000sp, 1800cp

All perms need to have coins SET based generally on these
ttype settings. Ttypes are meant primarily for mobile,
random mobs, not for perms. This is important since we
are going to be less perm based than mobile based. 

IF A TTYPE IS NOT SET, the game will load a monster with a 
default ttype based on its mtype. All creatures without mtypes 
will have ttype 0 - so if you want the game to decide the 
coins your monsters drop, just go through and set all their 
mtypes. If the custom coin flag is set (mflag 177), or if the 
mob is a perm, it will override the autocoin set, and it will 
ignore treasure type alltogether.

Treasure types can be set by doing: *set c mob tt #

If you wish to see a mob's default type and coins that
would result, just set the ttype to 0, and then do:
*coins (mob) -d

Please use mflag 177 (custom coins) very rarely, and only
with DM permissionbed perm does NOT need to have this flag
set.

Any questions, ask a DM.
