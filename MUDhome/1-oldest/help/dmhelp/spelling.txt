Help on: *spelling

This command allows all people building rooms to spellcheck
their descriptions, and also to get a list of possible
replacement words if desired. DMs and CTs are also able to
add new words to the RoH dictionary.

Syntax: *spelling check [-s|-l|-a]
        *spelling learn <word>

-s: checks short description for misspellings.
-l: checks long description for misspellings.
-a: advises replacement words for found misspellings.

Default with no switches will spellcheck both long and short
descriptions. Currently, the -s and -l switches do not work. 
In addition, right now it will consider strange punctuation, 
as well as items in quotes as misspelled. This will be 
rectified eventually.
