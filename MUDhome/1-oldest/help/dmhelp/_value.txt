Help on: *value
         *coins

This command allows creators and higher to set a generic copper
value on a monster or object, and have the game convert it to
the proper coins automatically. The highest amount of coin the
monster carries can be specified for the conversion. Note that
for MONSTERS, this command will spread out coins leaning toward
silver and copper, as there is more silver and copper in the
economy than other coins. This is only if you do NOT specify
the highest coin to use.

Syntax: *coins (obj|mob) $# [highest coin value]
	  *value (obj|mob) $# [highest coin value]

For example, if you wanted to set a Highport guardsman to
carry equivalent value to 10355 copper coins, and the highest
coin you wanted him to carry would be gold, you'd do:
: *coins high $10355
Highest cointype set to gold.
The Highport guardsman's coins are now set to: 103gp 5sp 5cp.

If the highest coin is left off, it assumes alanthium is the
highest coin the monster will carry:
: *coins high $10000
The Highport guardsman's coins are now set to: 7pp 5gp 125sp 1250cp.

If the coins were not spread out, it would have set the guard to 1ap.

When at all possible, only make gold, plat, and alanthium available 
on the highest level or hardest mobs (this includes if they are 
in a hard area....higher level doesnt mean harder the time.)
