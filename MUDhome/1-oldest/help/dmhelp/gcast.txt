Help on:
	*GCAST [-r|s] <spell>

This function will globally cast a spell.  This function is limited to
non-offensive spells.  Using the -r option will result in the spell only
being cast in the room you are in. The -s option will silently cast
the spell.

example:
: *gcast protection
You cast protection on everyone.
Dominus (+) casts protection on everyone.

: *gcast -s vig
You silently cast vigor on everyone.
Dominus (+) silently casts vigor on everyone.
