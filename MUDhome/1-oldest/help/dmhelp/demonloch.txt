Demonloch:
The demonloch is an ancient lake formed out the caldera of an inactive volcano.
In the past during the kingdom of Caladonia (before the present empire) it used
to be used as a resort for the nobility. Several villas surround the lake, including
a second palace for the former King. During the time of troubles when Talon the
Conqueror took over (read the HELP ARAMON file), nightshades under order of
Darsk murdered systematically over 2-3 nights every noble staying in those
villas. The lake used to be called Tranquil lake, due to its calm dark blue water.
The area is now used by clerics of Aramon as a spawning ground for creating
an army of minor demons. This has not been going on long, and the old King's
palace has been converted to this use. There is not an army as yet. This plan was
put into place to help defeat the Dagaran Nomads, which have stopped Caladon's
orc legions in their tracks, much like how the Germans stopped the Roman Empire. 
hen you think Dagarans, think Aiel from Jordan...Many strange or evil creatures, 
drawn by the evil taint of Aramon and from the Nightshades who once were swarming 
the place, now live in and around the lake, including an ancient bronze dragon who 
refuses to leave his home, even though surrounded by evil creatures, which he 
commonly eats and hunts for fun.
