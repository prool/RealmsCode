Description:
Manticores have been sighted in the deep Bloodmound
Hills. They feed on gnomes, orcs, gnolls, werewolves,
anything they can find when they take to the sky.
You will be building their lair. The area is pretty
small, a tiny cave/cavern complex with a couple rooms
outside it. All the rooms should not be used inside
the caves. Inside the cave it should smell very
disgusting, with rotting corpses all over the place.
There should be bones with rotting flesh on them,
and chewed-on bones. Think of an unclean animal and
what its den would look and smell like. Manticores 
have the body of a lion, the head of a man with a 
beard, and huge bats' wings. They have a long tail 
which has razor sharp spikes sticking out of it which
they can launch at their foes. This might be coded
into the game eventually as a monster flag.

Monster specifics:
Manticores should be from 8-10th level, *balanced
normally. "Manticore" doesnt have to be the only
name you use. You can also vary the names based
on their fur color or age: grey-maned manticore, 
manticore cub, red-bearded manticore, etc...They
should all be aggro, save maybe the young. They
should also have an alignment range of -50 to -20,
and drop around 500 to 1000 gold. They should be
very strong and dextrous, have high constitution, 
and have low intelligence and piety.

Drops:
Manticores would drop things like manticore spikes,
gems of various types, half-eaten bones, manticore
hides, manticore manes, etc...

Description:
This part of the lower Durgas River is known for its
giant frogs. In nearby Tradetown, their legs are sought
after as a very rich delicacy. They aren't that easy
to aquire though. The area they live in is only four
rooms really. Two rooms should be above ground, and
two should be below. One should be an egg chamber, and
should be the only place where young would be. Below
water rooms need the player harm and water flags set.
The two above water rooms will actually be IN the
river, but wading in the shallows. The current is
strong, so the Difficult Move room flag, along with
the water room flag needs to be set there, as well
as the "environment destroys dropped items" flag.

Monster specifics:
Giant frogs need to be from level 4 to level 6, *balanced
normally or weak. They will show up in 2s. "giant frog"
is not the name that should be used for them. More
descriptive names should be chosen. A max number of 6 mobs 
should ever be allowed to be in any one room in this 
area, and the traffic needs to be no higher than 30%.
Giant frogs are poisonous, so they need the poisons flag.
Female frogs, in the underwater rooms, should be aggro, 
because they defend their young. Giant frogs drop no gold. 
They should have average strength, high dex, normal con, 
and animal int and pie. They are neutral in alignment.

Drops:
They will drop giant frog membranes, giant frog legs, a
frog's tongue, and maybe frog slime.

Area Name.......Owlbears!
Location........Druidwood
Size............20 rooms
Room numbers....8600-8619
Mob numbers.....8600-8619
Obj numbers.....8600-8619

Description:
In the deep Druidwood, there is a druid enclave where
the center of the Order for the southern lands is. In
the forest before you get there, is a maze-like area
of trees, with a hole leading to an owlbear den in it.
The owlbears are charmed by the druids to guard the
enclave. This area constitutes the maze of trees, as 
well as the hole and the den inside.

Monsters:
Owlbears should be from levels 9 to 12, balanced buff.
Owlbears are vicious creatures, with the body of a
bear and the head of a huge owl. They have razor-sharp
claws, a razor-sharp beak, and they are as strong as
a hill giant. They are fanatically territorial, and
usually only magic can control them. They should be
extremely strong, be relatively dextrous, have a very
high constitution, and have animal int and pie. Names
should not just be "owlbear", but should reflect color
and age. Owlbears are strictly neutral in alignment.
They drop no gold. They should be aggro evil AND aggro
good. Only neutrals are safe from them. ONE type of
them needs to be random-aggro.

Drops: They'd drop owlbear feathers (of various colors),
owlbear claws, other things u can think of that make
sense.
