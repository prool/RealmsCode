Help on:
	*DELETE [-ASLPE] <string>

This command allows you to get delete text in a room description.

Flags:
----------------------
  A	Deletes everything in the room description. This flag must be used by
	itself, ie: "*del -A".

  S	Specifies that the short description should be targeted. If used alone,
	this will delete the entire short description.

  L	Specifies that the long description should be targeted. If used alone,
	this will delete the entire long description.

  P	This will delete the phrase from the room description. If you specify
	short or long description, it will only search that description.

  E	This will delete everything after the phrase. If "P" is specified, the
	phrase itself will also be deleted. If this command is searching both
	the long and short descriptions, it will delete everything after the
	matched phrase. If it is searching a specific description (long or
	short), it will stay within the specified description.
