Dragons on ROH are intended to be really hard.
We are hoping to make it so NOBODY can solo
a dragon.  Large groups of players should
be required to kill any dragon.
To accomplish this, please set flags 23,
44, and 45.  Also set a breath weapon flag
and several other flags to make it tough, like
resist spells.

All dragons should cast spells, with extended realms.

All dragons should be named, like this:
Mattree the copper dragon

Don't make ANY wandering dragon mobs.  If you want
something wandering, and draconic, use the words
dragonnette, or pseudo-dragon, or wyvern
True Dragons should be perms.

Also, dragons should be relatively rare.
Please don't add a dragon to your area
without DM permission, and DM won't be 
granted unless you are building a wilderness
area at least 200 rooms or larger.
