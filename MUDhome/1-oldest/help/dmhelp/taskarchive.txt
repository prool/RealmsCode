I redescripted, reflagged, renamed, re-exited, etc.. 
all rooms 8301-8399, and 5850-5860. I still
need to finish 5861-5899 to finish my area, until
I can start to add shit. Anyway. Been Busy.
Later

Fixed a thing with Hethe who drops Elicia's ring
to it being the correct ring to trade to elicia
for sapphire earrings. For some reason it was changed
to a different ring than the one she traded for.

Had a spurt of inspiration to add a bit more of
a newbie friendly atmosphere in the University Suds Bar
I added a drunken college student and drunken blonde mob
to show up...good for lower levels. I'll broadcast that
it's open when I make a good barkeep for the place 
and maybe add a waitress to the random slot.
Anyway, good for newbies. Alrdy opened, just not announced yet.
-Ulfang

<Ulfang on Fri Nov 30 12:53:49 2001>
fixed gnome gate in firedrakes to being locked
and closed now. It hasn't been for some time.
Also, the entrance to village of outcasts
via normal route-through swamp trolls-
is not 'open', it says, exits "off map"
if anyone knows why...let me know
you also cannot reach village of outcasts
via plane-shift either. Atleast I can't.
-Ulfang

<Ulfang on Sun Dec  2 20:18:25 2001>
Added some more items to the mobs in University Suds.
It's pretty cool, alot like your avg. local
college bar. I'll be adding a barkeep later perhaps.
Up to Oce. I'll also be finishing up my descriptions
for my last 40 rooms later also.
Ciao

Descripted all of the Hampton Goblin
Cave rooms. I am going to re-do mobs
and objects later.
-Ulfang

<Ulfang on Wed Dec  5 03:59:45 2001>
Made some new mobs for the
goblin lair in Hampton.
Environmental Health final tomorrow. Woopee!
G'Night
-Ulfang

<Ulfang on Thu Dec  6 00:27:19 2001>

-Ulf

<Ocelot on Thu Dec  6 11:06:24 2001>
Garbagetruck, Jolly, Branch, and Forx have all been bugged
for surveillance.

<Ocelot on Fri Dec  7 12:56:12 2001>
mflag 185 will now make mobs with that flag set kill
a master and not a pet. This will cut down considerably
on people soloing everything on the map with pets.
Mobs with intelligence 15+ also automatically act in
this manner.

I was going to do something today, but
I can't stand using telnet to build so this is
very difficult...

When I get home I'm going to fix some things
and then Im going to place mobs
in the cave. Then this will be
ready to be opened.

[Izzhar on Fri Feb 15 03:25:04 2002]
