SHOPLIFT IS DEBUGGED AND READY TO GO.

Ok.....players can now shoplift in a shop if you
set the shoplift rflag (46). There are a couple
other things you should know before setting any
shops this way.

FIRST...You must make mobs that guard the shop.
These mobs are PERMED in the STOREROOM of the
shop. If a shoplifter fails, ALL of these mobs
will run into the shop and attack him/her. It
is just like an alarm trap, except these mobs
automatically get d-i and detect-mist and block
set on them. If there are any perms in the shop
itself (the shopkeeper and ANY others) they will
also ALL attack the shoplifter as well. If you
do not *perm at least TWO guard mobs of at least
level 10 in the storeroom, shoplift will not work.
It is idiot proof now, so there's no way a screw
up by us can allow players to exploit it any more.

You must perm your guard mobs with timeouts of
3-5 seconds. DO NOT perm them at 3600.

Mobs which chase players out of the shops (like
when they flee or hazy) will wait around for a time
then wander on their own. When they wander, it will
say they are wandering off to look for (person). In
actuality, all they are doing is wandering away.

Any goods stolen from a shop cannot be sold in
a pawn, as they are "hot" and not wanted by the
shopkeep. This was done to prevent high level
thieves (who can shoplift well) from using shoplift
as a loophole to get ez gold.

If you want to put an item in a shopliftable shop that
you dont want able to be shoplifted, you can set the
"no shoplift" oflag(106) on it.

As a general rule, try not to make more then 3 guard
mobs in any given store, and try not to make it so
they completely PASTE someone who fails a shoplift,
since several people are gonna try this when we tell
them all about it. Whenever possible, however, be sure
both assist flags (100 AND 101) are set on all guard mobs.

I pitty the fool who fails a shoplift in Igmoo's shop...
cackle.....

Any questions, ask me...
