
DMs and CTs Playing - The Non-negotiable Rules

1. You will complete 20 rooms per week, or the equivalent.
2. You will not have a staff character logged on while you
   play, under ANY circumstances. (Logs do not lie)
3. If there is even a hint that people suspect you are staff
   playing a character, your player goes byebye.
4. These rules are non-negogiable. If you cannot abide by them,
   people will just not be allowed to play again.
5. You will use the tasklog to keep everyone informed of all
   work you complete every time you do anything. *dmh task
