Help on: *reset

	This command allows a Creator or higher to reset all permanent
object and monster timeout information to 0. This needs to be done when
an admin kills a perm monster or gets and object, and wants it to come
back before its timeout period. Simply run *reset, then *t back into
the room instead of unperming an re-perming everything.

Example
:*reset
Permanent object and creature timeouts reset.
