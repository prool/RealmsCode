Help on: *xdelete

This command allows a CT or DM to delete all exits in a room.
It is to be used in place of the editor to fix a room's messed
up or corrupted rooms without having to blow away the entire
room file from disk and rebuild it. Creators and builders do
not have access to this command, due to the sheer amount of
damage one of them could do with it if ever disgruntled.
