Help on: *questmode

This command allows a DM to place the game into QuestMode. During
QuestMode, no pkilling is possible, and other parameters may change
as needed. It is possible to see if the game is in QuestMode by
doing the *info command. QuestMode will disable itself if no DMs
are logged on, or DMs are on, but idle for more than a certain time.
