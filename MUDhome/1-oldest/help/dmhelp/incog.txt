Help on DM command:
	INCOG

Toggles the incognito flag on a DM. When set, the DM will be visibile
only to those in the same room. Any global commands (broadcast, tell)
will identify the DM, but players will not be able to detect him
(who, whois, tell).

*incog and incog are the same command.

: *incog
You cloak your presence.
: incog
You unlock your pressence.
