Help on:
	*clear [o|c] [index]

This will clear a single object or creature from the database.  All 
data associated with the deleted creature or item is lost from the disk 
file.  This information may, in some cases, still exist in memory.  
  If you accidentally delete an object or creature from your database you
may be able to recover it partially buy using *monster [index] to load a
monster from memory and then use *save to resave back to the deleted idex. 

example:
:*clear o 10
Object #10 deleted.
:*clear c 10
Creature #10 deleted.
