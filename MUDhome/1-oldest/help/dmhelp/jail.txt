Help on: *jail <player> <minutes> [-b]

	This command allows a CT or DM to jail a player for a 
specified time. They are auto-released after the specified time 
is up. It does not matter if they remain online or go offline. 
The time still ticks down. The command can be used on both online 
and offline players. The -b switch will broadcast to the mud when 
the player is jailed. Default is always 1 minute. All jailings 
are logged in the log directories for immortals.
Example
:*jail (asshole) 15 -b
:*jail (asshole) 30
