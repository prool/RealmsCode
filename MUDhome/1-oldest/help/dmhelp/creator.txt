proposed new class Creator

  This would be an intermediary class between 
builder and CT
  Basically it would be for people 
that we don't mind *sending to, but don't trust
enough to make full CT

Powers allowed 
All Builder commands (appending rooms etc.)
modify mobs except can not set exp on mobs
*send
*teleport
*users
*stat
*mon

Powers NOT allowed
modify objects
set exp on mobs
*list
*create


   ocelot mentioned we might not need a new class,
just a new flag on the CT or builder class
here's why i'd like to see this done:
   with this set up, its very difficult for a 
creator to cheat, so we could allow creators 
to still play

  if we were to make this class, we could ask 
all the CTs
if they wanna stay CT, or go down to creator
if they go down, they could play again

   also, i feel like i can't promote any 
builders right now
cause then i'd have to ask them to suicide 
all their characters, i don't think they will
 but i really don't want to become a pure 
mob-builder but at the rate these new builders
 are going, i'm going to
have my hands full making mobs to fill up 
all these new areas

 well look it over, and tell me any problems
 you might see with it

   (I think we might automatically demote 
gonjinn, occulus and darklight)
