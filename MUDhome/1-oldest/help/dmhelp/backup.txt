Help on: *backup

This command allows DMs to backup and restore players from disk.
Whenever a player level 7 or above dies, is dusted, or suicides,
they are automatically backed up as (player).bak at the following
path: /home/realms/realms/player/backup. This command is used to
take advantage of that while online within the game.

Syntax: *backup <player> [-d|-r]

Examples:
:*backup ocelot
Ocelot has been backed up.
*** Ocelot backed up Ocelot to disk.
:*backup ocelot -d
Deleted Ocelot.bak from disk.
*** Ocelot deleted Ocelot's backup file.
:*backup olmo -r
*** Ocelot restored Olmo from auto-backup.
Restoring Olmo from last auto-backup.
