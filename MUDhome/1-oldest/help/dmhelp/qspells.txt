Spells/Quests Needed

Following are the spells/quests we need to put in the game.
Areas can be built for these purposes. I want final approval
of any ideas people have to be given by me before they put
any of these in, however. I wont be too picky, just dont
think up gay quest ideas.. Each one has a difficulty rating
by it to give you an idea of what I expect.
RATING        DESCRIPTION
1: Relatively easy..a mob which ppl have to find can drop it.
2: Easy but complex. A single trade of some item can be 
   involved to get the item/scroll.
3: Complex. More than one trade needs to be involved.
4: Complex and dangerous. More than one trade, and some mob
   or mobs need to be involved which need to be defeated and
   drop one or more of the items.
5: Complicated and dangerous. Items need to be gained and
   mobs killed for items all over the map. At least 4 steps
   need to be involved, with clues being put in to guide
   players. There should always be a way for people to be
   thrown off...like assuming the wrong thing.
Q#: Spell also needs to be a quest. # is xp for quest.
