DM function *SET

This function allows the DM to set any variable on an exit, room,
player, monster, or object. The syntax is different for each class of
thing. This file will discuss each class beginning with exits. 

Making & Deleting EXITS:

*set [rm #] x [exit name] [link to rm #]

If you omit the [rm #] section, it will assume that you mean the 
parent room (the one you are in). To create an exit you specify
the exit name and the room number to link it to.  

example:
:*set x north 60
	[creates an exit named 'north' leading to room 60]
:*set x d 61
	[creates an exit named 'door' leading to room 61]

Some exit names can be abbreviated. They are
	All cardinal directions (n, e, sw)
	d ->  door
	o ->  out
	p ->  passage
	t ->  trap door
	a ->  arch
	g ->  gate
	st -> stairs

To DELETE an exit, use 0 as the [link to rm #].  
To RENAME an exit, use *xrename.
	
If you use "." as the [link to rm #], then it will link both rooms 
with the same [exit name] in each room. Special exits:
	all cardinal directions (north, east, southwest, etc).
	up
	down
will instead have the opposite direction as the return exit. Thus,
*set x up 60 . would set and up exit to room 60 and a down exit in
room 60 leading back.


To set FLAGS on exits, the syntax is:

*set xf [exit name] [flag number]

This will toggle the flag named in [flag number] on the 
exit [exit name].


To see PASSPHRASE on an exit, the syntax is:
	*set xpp [exit name] [phrase]
To see PASSLANG on an exit, the syntax is:
	*set xpl [exit name] [language]

To see ONENTER on an exit, the syntax is:
	*set xe [exit name] [phrase]

Setting up ROOMS:

*set r [trfbxe] [<value>]

To set the traffic on a room use the 't' case and the value 
following it will be taken as the new traffic value.

example:
:*set r t 100
Traffic is now 100%.

To set a flag on the room use the 'f' case and the flag number 
specified in [<value>] will toggle. *dmh rflags has a list of flags
yoy can use.

example:
:*set r f 10
Room flag #10 on.

To put a new random monster into a room use the 'r' case and the
value following is the random slot (1-10).  A third variable must be set 
and that will provide the monster number to put into the random slot.

example:
:*set r r3 60
Random #3 is now 60.
:*set r r4 65
Random #4 is now 65.

To set level boundaries for a room you must specify whether you 
want to set high or low boundaries.  This is done by either 'l' or 'h' 
next to the case 'b'.  The level boundary is set by the value following 
the case and type of boundary to set.

example:
:*set r bl 10
Low level boundary 10. (You can't go in if your level 10+)
:*set r bh 4
High level boundary 4. (You must be level 4+ to go into the room.)

To put a trap in a room use the 'x' case and the value that 
follows will be the trap type placed into the room.

example:
:*set r x 3
Room has trap #3 set.

example:
:*set r exp 300
This will give people 300 experience the first time they enter the room.


Use *dmh traps to see a list of traps you can use.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set up PLAYERS:

*set c <name> <al|con|c|dex|e|f|g|hm|h|i|l|mm|m|pie|p#|r#|s|clan> [<val>]

	The variables you can set are:
	al 		alignment
	con		constitution
	c		class
	dex		dexterity
	e		experience
	f		flag toggle
	g		gold
	h		current hp
	hm		max hp
	i		intellegence
	l		level
	m		current mp
	mm		max mp
	p# <val>	gives <val> hits to proficiency #
	pie		piety
	r		race
	r# <val>	gives <val> hits to realm #
	s		strength
        clan #          sets clan 0 - 10
	
example:
:*set c joe h 20
	[joe now has 20 hp]
:*set c jim f 2
	[jim is now hidden]
:*set c jim r0 160000
        [jim now has 160000 hits in his earth realm (roughly 50%).]
:*set c jim p2 10000
        [jim now has 10000 hits in his blunt proficiency.]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set up MONSTERS' variables:
Everything you can *set for a player, you can also *set for a 
monster. In addition, you may/must also *set the following:
      
        ar           set armor class
	dn           set number of dice damage
        ds           set sides per dice damage
        dp           set plus on damage die-roll
	thac         set thac0 "To Hit Armor Class 0"
        num          set max number that load at one time
        inv # (item) set monster's inventory slot number to (item)
        sp #         toggle on and off spell # (*dmh sflags)

example:
:*set c grendel dn 4
	[Grendel now hits with 4 dice damage]
:*set c arthur thac 14
	[Arthur has a thac0 of 14]
:*set c rat num 6
      [Between 1 and 6 rats will arrive at a time]
:*set c peasant inv 1 knife
      [This will set the peasants first inventory slot]
      [to the item number of the knife. You must have ]
      [the knife in your inventory when you do this.  ]
      [Monsters have 10 inventory slots max to set.   ]
:*set c wizard sp 31
      [This will turn on the spell waterbolt so ]
      [the wizard knows it. If it were already  ]
      [on, this would turn it off. *dmh sflags  ]
      [will show you the number for each spell. ]     

NOTE: You may also teach spells to monsters just as you
      would teach a player, but you cannot unteach the
      spells. To do this you have to toggle the spell
      off with *set as above, using the spell's number.
            
NOTE: To determine how often a monster casts spells in combat rather
      then hitting only, you must *set their proficiency 0 from 1
      to 100. You must also *set the casts spells flag (18) as well
      as the magic percent flag (43). You may also *set their realms
      just as you would do a player with [*set c (mon) r(0-3) (value)].

For example: (remember to set flags 18 and 43 first)
*set c wizard p0 50
     [This will make the wizard cast 50% of the time]    
*set c wizard r3 160000
     [This will give the wizard 160000 shots in his water realm (~50%)]

To figure out how many shots correspond to a certain % in realms or profs,
just *set yourself to various numbers and do an info to see the affects.

To set OBJECT variables:

*set o <name> [<crt>] <ad|ar|dn|ds|dp|f|m|sm|s|v|wg|wr|t|sp|lvl> [<val>]

	variables are:
	ad		adjustment (+)
	ar		armor class
	dn		number of dice damage
	ds		sides of dice damage
	dp		bonus/plus to damage die-roll
        f <val>         toggles flag #<val> (*dmh oflags)
	m		magic power (*dmh sflags)
	s		shots current
	sm 		shots max
	v		value
	wg		weight
        wr              wear location flag (*dmh wear)
        t #             set object type (*dmh otypes)
        sp #            special object type
        lvl #           level restriction (minimum level to use)

For example:
:*set o shield ar 2
      [The shield will lower AC by 2 steps if worn.]
:*set o sword adj 3
      [The sword is now +3]
:*set o galvorn lvl 7
      [Players must be level 7 to use this galvorn blade.]
:*set o parch t 8
      [This turns the parchment to a scroll.]
:*set o ring v 1000
      [The ring is now worth 1000gp]
