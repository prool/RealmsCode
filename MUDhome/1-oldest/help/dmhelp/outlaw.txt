Help on: *outlaw

This command is used by DMs and certain select CTs to set
the outlaw flag on misbehaving players. It has several
options which allow for different levels of the outlaw
flag. In order for a CT to use this command, a flag must
be set on them by a DM. The command has many switches,
all of which will be explained below.

syntax: *outlaw <player> <minutes> [-a|-s|-x]
        *outlaw <player> [-f|-r]

The first line of switches can only be done when first
setting a player to outlaw, and can all be done in the
process of that first command. For example:
: *outlaw bob 5 -a -s -x
Or
: *outlaw bob 10 -x -s
Or
: *outlaw bob 7 -a
etc...

Switch definitions:
-a: Makes mobs flagged outlaw aggro attack a player.
-s: Makes a player not able to set nosummon.
-x: Makes a player lose xp from pkill losses.

The following switches can only be used once a player
is already an outlaw:
-f: Tells you which of the above switches are set on the
    player, and also the time remaining on their outlaw.
-r: DM only. Allows a DM to cancel a player's outlaw sentence.
