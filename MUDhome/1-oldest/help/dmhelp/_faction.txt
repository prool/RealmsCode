Help on: *faction

This command allows Creators on up to view a monster or player's
set faction. Only Caretakers and DMs can view player factions,
and Creators are limited to viewing faction on monsters within
their set allowed range. It also allows DMs and Caretakers to
set all of a creature's factions to 0. Only DMs can set all of
a given player's factions to 0 - Caretakers can only do this to
monsters.
