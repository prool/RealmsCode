Help on DM command:

        *advance [player] [level]

This will change the level of a character to a specified level.  It will
also update hit points and magic points (It can lower, too.). Note that
this will also set their max level, so if you *advance someone to 30 and
then *advance them to 1, they will "relevel" all the way back to 30. Fix
this by: *set c [character] alvl [level].

example:
:*advance Terrance 5

Terrance has been raised to level 5.
