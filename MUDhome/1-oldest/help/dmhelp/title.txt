Help on DM command:
	TITLE

Changes the player's title to the desired text. Keep in mind that
this title will stick even as the character levels. Once changed
the player's title will no longer go through the title-changing cycle.

Use the -d flag to delete a player's custom title.

Title the player "[custom]" (without quotes) to let them choose their
own title using the title command.
