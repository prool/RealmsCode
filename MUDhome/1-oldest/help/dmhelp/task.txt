Help on: *task

This command allows any immortal to either view or
append to the Realms Tasklog. The tasklog is used
to keep the staff apprised of what all is going on
and what everyone else is doing. It is a very very
important communications mechanism. Whenever a staff
member does anything on the mud (builds, comes up
with an idea, fixes something, finds a bug, etc..)
it should be posted to the tasklog using this command.

Syntax: *task [-a|-d]

Switch desctiptions:
-a: This allows you to append a new entry to the task
    log. Entries should be kept brief and to the point.
-d: This allows a DM to delete the current tasklog.
    Only one DM should be in charge of doing this at
    any given time.

Using the command with no switches allows you to simply
view the tasklog as if it were a mudmail message.
