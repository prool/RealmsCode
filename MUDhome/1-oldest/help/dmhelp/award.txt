Help on: *award [-g]

     This command allows DMs and some CTs to award experience
to players for good roleplaying. For a CT to do it, they must
have a flag set on them by a DM to turn the ability on. Xp may
only be awarded to a player for roleplaying every hour and fifteen
minutes. The amount awarded is 1% of the person's total xp, with
100xp being the minimum amount awarded. Somewhere between levels
6 and 7, the award starts going up for people. All awards by
anyone are logged. If you wish to award someone gold as well, you
may use the -g switch, which will place an amount of gold equal
to half the amount of xp awarded into the person's bank account.
A minimum of 250 gold will be awarded when using this option.
