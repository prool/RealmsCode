	*<replace | substitute> [-SL#<num>] <search> <replace>

This function will replace text in a room description. If you do not specify
the short or long description, it will look in both. Note that, without
deliminators, "search" can only be one word.


   *replace this is a long phrase

will replace "this" with "is a long phrase". To be more precise, use a
deliminator:


   *replace "this is" "a long phrase".

You can use quotes ("), and apostraphe ('), or an asterisk (*), but you must
be consistent about what deliminator you are using.


  *replace -#3l "the people" "the monks"

will replace the third occurance of "the people" with "the monks" in the
long description.
