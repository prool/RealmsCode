Help on:
	*dust <name> [-n]

This command utterly destroys the named character.  They are kicked off of
the game, and their player file is deleted.  Only DMs may use this command.

example:
:*dust ninja
### Ninja has been turned to dust! We'll miss him dearly.
### Ninja just logged off.
Ominous thunder rumbles in the distance.

Using the -n switch eliminates the mud broadcast in order that someone can
be dusted without the entire mud knowing about it. It also eliminates the
room broadcast as well. All DMs/CTs will still see the message broadcasted
however. The "Ominous thunder rumbles in the distance." message will still
happen, but the players will not know who was dusted.
