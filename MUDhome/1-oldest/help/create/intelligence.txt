INTELLIGENCE:

Intelligence is the most important attribute for most spell casting
classes. The higher your intelligence is, the higher the bonus you get on
the damage your spells do. In addition, the higher the number you have in
intelligence, the longer your stuns last when you use the stun spell. This
is very important for all casting classes. Intelligence also determines how
many magic points you regenerate back at a time. If you are a bard or
vampire, intelligence helps determine how successful you are when you try
to charm or hypnotize. If a cleric has a higher intelligence then piety, it
helps him heal more hit points when using the vigor and mend-wound spells.
Last but not least, a the higher your intelligence is, the less chance you
have of spell failure.
