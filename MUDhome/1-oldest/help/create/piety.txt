PIETY:

Piety is another extremely important attribute to most of the spellcasting
classes. For all classes except liches, piety determines how often you
regain hit points and magic points. If your piety is lower, you will tick
less often then if it is high, and your character wont regenerate his hit
points and magic back as quickly. Piety also helps you to search. Also, the
lower your piety is, the most likely an aggressive monster will attack you
as opposed to someone else in the room with a higher piety. Generally, the
higher your piety is, the more you will heal back when you use the vigor
or mend wound spells.
