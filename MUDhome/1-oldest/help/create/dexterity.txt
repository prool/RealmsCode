DEXTERITY:

Dexterity is an important stat for some classes but not for others. First
off, higher dexterity lets you hide better. It also determines your chances
of fleeing successfully. If you are a berserker or fighter, it helps you
circle better the higher it is. For thieves, it assists you in your ability
to steal. Last but not least, a higher dexterity makes it so monsters and 
players have a harder time hitting you.
