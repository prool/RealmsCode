There are three commands to remember when using the in-game mudmail system:
  sendmail
  readmail
  deletemail

These commands only work in a post office, and allow you to send kludgy
little letters to other players that play the game. To send a letter to
another player, you use the SENDMAIL command. To read your mail, use the
READMAIL command. And to delete your mail once you've read it use the
DELETEMAIL command. The text editor for the sendmail command is very
primitive and does not have word wrap, so do not make lines longer than
80 characters in length.
