syntax: target [creature|-c]

With no argument this command will show you who you are currently
targetting.  With a creature for an argument it will set your target
to that creature. Using -c as an argument will clear your target.

Once you have a target set, you can use offensive commands without
an argument.

Ex:

: ^ytar^x
You are targetting: Noone!
