The feeblemind spell decreases your intellgience, hindering your reasoning and
making you completely vulnerable to confusion attacks. This spell does not last
long, but while it is in effect, you will have less mana. An insight spell
counteracts the effects of a feeblemind spell.

Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
