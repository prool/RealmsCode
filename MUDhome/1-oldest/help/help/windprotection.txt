Wind-protection is a spell which will protect you from air-damaging rooms and
air-based attacks from monsters. An invisibile, intangible shield surrounding
the target will absorb some of the damage inflicted upon them from the previous
sources, but keep in mind: it does NOT protect the target from air-based spells.

Syntax:
cast wind-protection <target>
