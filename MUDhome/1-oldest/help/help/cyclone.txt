This spell causes an intense cyclone of wind to swirl around a target,
tearing it in several directions and ripping it apart. In addition, any
sharp objects caught up in the cyclone will slash at the target, often
causing extensive bleeding. This spell is the second most powerful spell
in the air realm.

Syntax:
cast cyclone <target>
