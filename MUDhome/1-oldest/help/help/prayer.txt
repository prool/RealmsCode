The prayer spell exalts you in the eyes of your deity, increasing your piety.
This spell does not last long, but while it is in effect, you will have more
mana. A damnation spell counteracts the effects of a prayer spell.

A prayer spell will not work in conjunction with clerical pray.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast prayer <target>
