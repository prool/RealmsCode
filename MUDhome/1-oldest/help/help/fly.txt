This spell allows its target to fly as if it had grown wings. Obviously,
this spell allows the target to obtain heights normally unreachable by
normal means, ones in which land-bound creatures cannot normally reach.
This often opens up many new avenues of exploration.

Syntax:
cast fly <target>
