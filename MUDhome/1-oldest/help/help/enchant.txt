This spell places an enchantment upon a weapon or armor. The level of
enchantment placed depends upon the level of the caster. Enchantment enchances
the physical properties of objects, such as lifespan, amount of damage done, or
amount of protection provided. Enchant may only be cast by mages and liches of
16th level or greater.

Enchant is also an ability gained by mages (not liches). It allows them to
temporarily enchant an itme in their inventory even if they do not know the
enchant spell. The item will work as a magical item for the duration. The mage
can use the enchant ability at 10th level, and the strength of the enchantment
depends on the caster.
