This spell allows its target to remove curses. If the target is afflicted with
a curse (such as bleeding wounds), the spell will remove all curse effects
from the player but will not uncurse their items.

If the target is not under a curse, then any items worm will have their curse
removed. For the darkness curse specifically, this will include any items in
their inventory excluding items inside a bag. The removal of curses from items
is permanent.

Syntax:
cast remove-curse <target>
