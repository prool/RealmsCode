Minotaurs are a magical creation from long ago. They are the result of some
twisted archmage's experiment, crossing a bull and a human. The result was a
very large humanoid creature with the head of a bull and the body of a human.
Minotaurs have very brute strength and little intellect. They often live in
areas which are often confusing to travel in, such as mazes and rocky canyons.
Minotaurs have a habit of eating human flesh as well, but not so much as ogres
and trolls. Minotaurs also have the misfortune of having the worst body odor
in all the land.
