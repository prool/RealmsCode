Bribe allows you to offer monsters money in the hope that they will leave
the room, not bothering you anymore. This is useful if you want a monster
to stop guarding a treasure you'd like to take or if you're really getting
womped in the middle of combat. The higher the level, the more money the
monster will want.

Example:
: bribe doc $50
The doctor takes your money, but stays.
: bribe doc $500
The doctor takes your money and leaves.
