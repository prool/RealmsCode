Static-field is a spell which will protect you from electricity-damaging
rooms and lightning-based attacks from monsters. An invisibile, intangible
shield surrounding the target will absorb some of the damage inflicted upon
them from the previous sources, but keep in mind: it does NOT protect the
target from electricity-based spells.

Syntax:
cast static-field <target>
