The wall of force spell will create an immovable, impenetrable barrier to
block an exit. The wall of force will also block the exit in the target room
that leads back to the room you are in, if one could be found. No one - not
even the caster - may pass through this wall. A wall of force may be brought
down by a disintegrate spell.

Syntax:
cast wall-of-force <exit>
