The dense-fog spell will summon a cloud of magical fog to the area. This
fog makes it difficult to see - all creatures in the room will find it
more difficult to hit enemy combatants. The spell will also make it more
difficult to scout either into or out of the room. All creatures in a room
with a dense fog spell cast will have an easier time hiding in shadows.

Syntax:
cast dense-fog
