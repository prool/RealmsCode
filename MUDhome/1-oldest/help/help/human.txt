Humans are the most populous race in Derlith. They are often able to excel in
any class. Most other races take a neutral view of humans, some viewing them all
as being petty and materialistic. Some races, like orcs, ogres, and trolls, view
humans as arch enemies or even as a food source. Humans are definitely the most
flexible and powerful race in all of Derlith. Due to their flexibility and
diversity, Humans are able to choose one stat to raise and one stat to lower
during character creation.
