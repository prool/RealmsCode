Bandage is a command used in order to heal wounds with bandages you may
find or buy. Different bandages may heal for more then others. A bandage
item doesnt have to be a "bandage" per say, but can also have the same
effect. For example, a healing salve, ointment, or a healing gem. Whether
the item is an actual bandage or not, the bandage command is used to
activate it. You may bandage yourself or a target monster or player.
Bandaging cannot be done while in combat.
