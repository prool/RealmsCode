This spell allows you to see through the eyes of another player, showing
the location of the target. The spell works only for an instant, providing
a still-frame through the target's eyes. When cast, there is a chance that
the spell will go undetected. On the other hand, the target might notice
the magic even though the spell still succeeds.

Syntax:
cast clairvoyance <target>
