There are currently seberal songs which bards can sing. You receive the song of
healing at character creation. Talk to Aaron Silvertongue to receive information
about the other songs. To sing a song, merely type: sing <song>

The songs that are in the game are:
   healing	destruction
   holiness	mass-destruction
   magic	restoration
   flight	protection

To learn a new song, you will need to quest for a scroll. When you find the
scroll, study it and you will learn the new song.
