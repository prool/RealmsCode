This ability is gained by druids as soon as they become circle initiates.
It allows them to bring about a very strong layer of bark which covers
their skin and exposed areas of their bodies. As a result, they are much
harder to hit. The bark not only lowers a druid's armor class, but it also
absorbs damage. A bigger % of damage is absorbed the higher level the
druid is. Each use of this ability is different in power, and the more
robust a druid is, the better they are at this ability.
