This spell allows death knights and evil clerics (not Enoch clerics though)
to do damage to good players and creatures. Damage is based on the caster's
level and piety. You must be evil aligned to cast this it. Against summoned
good creatures, it is especially good. Note that there are good aligned
summoned creatures in the game.

Syntax:
