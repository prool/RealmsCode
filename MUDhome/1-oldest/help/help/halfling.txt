Halflings get their namesake from the fact that they are roughly half the size
of a human. Short and often plump, the halfling loves good food and drink. They
also tend to have more body hair then humans, with tufts on the backs of their
hands and feet. A halfling is very agile, owing to his small size. His small
size handicaps him, however, when strength is considered. Halflings make the
best thieves in Derlith, and almost everyone equates being a halfling and a
thief as being one in the same.
