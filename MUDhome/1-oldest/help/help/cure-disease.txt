This spell removes diseases. Though it will cure the common cold, the spell
is more often used to cure harmful diseases such as mummy rot. Any
ill-effects caused by the disease will remain, though the disease itself
will not. Only paladins and clerics may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast cure-disease <target>
