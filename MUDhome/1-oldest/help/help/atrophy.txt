This is the most powerful spell in the water realm. Strong elemental magics
cause the target to begin to shrivel and decay, withering into dust as the
water is sucked out. This causes a massive nervous-system breakdown,
dealing a large amount of damage to the target.

Syntax:
cast atrophy <target>
