The ranks within a guild are listed below in order of most important to
least important. A guildmaster may use the "^yguild promote^x" and
"^yguild demote^x" commands to change the rank of guild members.


^WGuildmaster^x

Each guild may only have one guildmaster. By default, this is the player that
founded the guild. A guildmaster may pass leadership of the guild to another
player by using the "^yguild abdicate^x" command.


^WBanker^x

Being a banker allows you to use all of the guild's bank-related commands.
A banker is also allowed to use the guildhall command to modify a room's name,
short description, and long description. Bankers may invite other players
into the guild.


^WOfficer^x

When creating a new guild, the players that support its creation are
automatically added to the guild as officers. Officers may invite other
players into the guild.


^WNormal Members^x

When inviting new members to the guild, invitees join as ordinary guild
members unless otherwise specified.
