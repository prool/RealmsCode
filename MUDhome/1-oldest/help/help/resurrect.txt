This spell allows a cleric of the goddess Ceris to resurrect a player from the
dead, nearly erasing their last non-pkill death, including all losses associated
with it. The cleric must be substantially high level in order to cast this
spell. The goddess grants it automatically upon leveling to nineteen. The spell
is detrimental to the caster; they will fall unconscious for 2 minutes and be
unable to tick mana for 20 minutes online. The target's death sickness duration
will be reduced to one-third.

THERE IS EXPERIENCE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH CASTING THIS SPELL. THE LOSS IS 30000,
or 10% OF WHAT WAS RESTORED TO THE TARGET PLAYER. THIS IS DUE TO THE EXTREMES
OF GUIDING SUCH STRONG LIFE ENERGY MAGIC, AND IS UNAVOIDABLE.

This spell must be cast upon a player while they are STILL IN LIMBO. If
they leave limbo, they cannot be resurrected. Resurrection will not work
on vampires or liches, and it has been known to destroy them irrevocably
if it is cast upon them.

NOTE: You can only cast resurrect OR be resurrected, once every real 24 hours
      time. Note also that only 80% of lost experience is restored.

Example:
### Sadly, Bob was killed by a wino.
: c resurrect bob
You cast a resurrection spell on Bob.
### Min just resurrected Bob from the dead!
You collapse from exhaustion.
