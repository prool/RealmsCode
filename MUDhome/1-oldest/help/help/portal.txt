The portal spell allows you take you and your companions to one of your
dimensional anchors. Depending on your level, only a certain number of people
may step through the portal before it closes. Only one person may pass through
at level 31, and every 2 levels thereafter will allow one more person to enter.
Note that when the caster passes through the portal or leaves the room the
portal was created in, it will close automatically.

You must be a mage or a lich and atleast level 31 to cast this spell. You
must be atleast 7th level to use a portal.

Syntax:
cast portal <anchor>
