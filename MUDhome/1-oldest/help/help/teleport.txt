This spell moves its target to a random place in the world. It is often seen as
an offensive spell, as it can send the target to areas inhabited by highly
aggresive monsters.

MP cost: 60

In conjunction with the anchor spell, a teleport spell can be directed to a
specific location, rather than a random location.

Only mages, liches, and bards of atleast 13th level may cast teleport.
