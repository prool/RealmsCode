The vampire is the undead creature of the night. He has a hatred of all that is
living, as he must rely on the blood of the living to survive. The night is the
vampire's kingdom. When the sun sets across Derlith, hordes of vampires come out
to feast. During the night, a vampire is able to bite any living creature, doing
massive damage in a single strike. He may also transform himself into a
translucent mist, unable to be detected until the time of his attack. Contrary
to popular belief, a vampire is not powerless when the sun comes up. A vampire
is often able to hypnotize his victim, even in daylight. This renders an enemy
harmless to the vampire, as the victim perceives the vampire to be a friend and
thus will not attack. There aren't many organizations across Derlith which a
vampire may join, as many are afraid of his unnatural power. At least one
organization solely for vampires is rumored to exist somewhere in Derlith,
however.
