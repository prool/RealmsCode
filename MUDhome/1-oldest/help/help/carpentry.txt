Capentry is a skill that will allow you to create weapons primarily made of
wood. Read through ^WHELP CRAFT^x for more information on creating items.
Pay special attention to these points:

 * Read section #2 about creating an item from a recipe as some carpentry
   recipes will require you to use a recipe in this manner.

 * Read section #4 about creating items of different sizes as this is
   possible with some carpentry recipes.
