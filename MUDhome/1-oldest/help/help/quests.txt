Quests are obtained by talking to various creatures around the world.  The
requirements vary by quest, but will often require you to visit a new place
in the world, kill some other monsters, and possibly obtain some items for
the creature.

Rewards also vary but generally include gold, experience and special items.

Some quests are repetable and can be done many times, others can only be
done once.  Some quests additionally have pre-requisites (other quests you
have to complete before you will be allowed to undertake the new quest)
