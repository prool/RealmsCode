This command allows fighters and berserkers to bash an opponent, knocking
it to the floor for several seconds.  Bash does half the normal damage of
a regular attack, but it also causes the opponent to be delayed for
several seconds while he tries to get up off the floor.  This in effect
gives the player the initiative. Note that large players may bash without
a weapon.

Syntax:
: bash wino
You are too small to bash without a weapon.
: wield hoe
You wield a hoe.
: bash wino
Your bash failed.
