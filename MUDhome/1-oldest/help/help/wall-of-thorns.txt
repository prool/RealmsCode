The wall of thorns spell will summon a barrier of thorns, blocking an exit.
The wall of thorns will also block the exit in the target room that leads back
to the room you are in, if one could be found. Anyone, besides the caster, who
passes through the wall of fire will take earth damage. A wall of thorns may be
brought down by a dispel-magic spell.

Syntax:
cast wall-of-thorns <exit>
