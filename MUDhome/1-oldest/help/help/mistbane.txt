Mistbane is a skill aquired by rangers at level 10 due to the fact that they
hunt vampires. In effect, the ranger brings into being a surge of positive
energy which allows him to counteract the negative energy used by a vampire to
enter mist form. In effect, this means the ranger is able to hit a vampire in
mist form with normal weapons. This ability does NOT allow a ranger to see a
misted vampire, and it is useless when not combined also with true-sight.
HELP TRUE-SIGHT for further information.
