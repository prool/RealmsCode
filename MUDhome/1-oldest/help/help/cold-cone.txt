This powerful spell causes a cone of deadly frost to spread out from the
caster's hand in a cone, freezing almost anything its path. In addition to
any frozen limbs the target might experience, the shock of the temperature
change often causes more severe wounds. Targets who are generally resist
to cold will not experience such drastic effects.

Syntax:
cast cold-cone <target>
