The werewolf is the render of flesh, the bane of mankind, and the creature of
the full moon. Werewolves often travel in packs in order to hunt their victims.
Werewolves are magical in nature, and thus are not harmed by traditional
weapons and attack techniques. Magic spells or enchanted weapons are required
to harm them. A werewolf never attacks with weapons, except on very rare
occasions. Instead, he uses powerful jaws and razor sharp claws to attack his
victims, rending them to a bloody pulp. A werewolf is able to fight in a wild
frenzy, attacking in a whirlwind to destroy his enemies. He may also maul his
victim, knocking him to the ground and rendering him helpless to fight back
for a time. Possessing a keen sense of smell, a werewolf is able even to
detect invisible opponents in his midst. Werewolves are also faster healers
then most, owing to their wild nature. No organization across Derlith will
accept a werewolf into their ranks. Just as well, a werewolf wants nothing
to do with any order but his own pack, and he will generally shun all
civilization. It is also well known throughout Derlith that werewolves detest
vampires and will kill them on sight.
