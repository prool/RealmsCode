There are currently nine schools of magic in the world:

    Abjuration           Conjuration
    Divination           Enchantment
    Evocation            Illusion
    Necromancy           Translocation
    Transmutation

Schools of magic are used by arcane spellcasters. Mages, liches, bards,
and vampires are arcane spellcasters.As the foundation of the new magic
system is in, but the full magic system has not yet been coded, your skill
level in each of these schools does not affect your spell-casting ability.
It will in the future, though, so train your skills as you normally would.
To see your skill level in all magic skills, type ^Yskills magic^x.

There are six temporary magic skills - they represent the six elemental
realms. They are:

    Air Realm            Cold Realm
    Earth Realm          Electric Realm
    Fire Realm           Water Realm
