The radiation spell will surround the target in a shield of magical flames,
flaring up and burning an enemy whenever the target is struck by physical
melee damage (bows and thrown weapons do not trigger this spell). The
damage to the attacker does not vary based on how much damage is dealt.

Syntax:
cast radiation <target>
