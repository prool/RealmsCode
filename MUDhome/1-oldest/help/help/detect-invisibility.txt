This spell allows its target to see invisible items and creatures by
connecting their eyes to a magical plane. For the duration of the spell,
the target will be able to see invisible things. Note, however, they will
not be able to detect mists. In addition to this, an object or exit that is
hidden and invisible will still remain hidden by the means of this spell.

Syntax:
cast detect-invisibility <target>
