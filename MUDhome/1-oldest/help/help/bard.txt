Bards are the traveling lore masters and storytellers of Derlith. Early on
in their lives, they set out to travel the land to find out as much as they
can. Often they attend colleges in order to gain expertise in particular
areas as well. As such, they know a lot about the lands and the creatures
in them. This gives bards a unique perspective on almost everything, and
chances are that they will know something about almost anything they find,
particularly items and weapons. A bard's singing ability is legendary, and
it is said to be able to heal the body. Some other more traveled bards are
said to be able to mentally revitalize those that hear their music. It is
also said that bards are able to learn songs which can damage their enemies
through the power of magic, 
as well as many other magical affects. Some
creatures are so enticed by a bards stories and song, that they are
instantly charmed and under the sway of the bard. Bards play a vital role
in Derlith, as they act as historians. Don't let this fool you. Bards are
quite roguish, and they definitely know how to have a
good time.
