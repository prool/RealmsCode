The insight spell increases your intellgience, strengthening your reasoning and
making you immune to confusion attacks. This spell does not last long, but
while it is in effect, you will have more mana. A feeblemind spell counteracts
the effects of an insight spell.

An insight spell will cancel the effects of confusion.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast insight <target>
