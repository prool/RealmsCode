The slow spell decreases your dexterity, making you slower and unable to perform
tasks as efficiently. This spell does not last long, but while it is in
effect, you are only able to attack every 4 seconds in combat instead of every 3.
A slow spell counteracts the effects of a haste spell.

A slow spell will cancel out the frenzy ability.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast slow <target>
