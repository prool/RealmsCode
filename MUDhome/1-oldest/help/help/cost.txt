The cost command allows you to see how much it will cost for a given smithy
to repair broken equipment. The cost in general is 1/2 that of the value of
any given item as shown by any pawn shop. This can change, however,
depending on the skill of any given smithy, or if you have opposing
alignment to a given smithy.

Syntax:
cost <object> <smithy>
