This spell nullifies the effects of a silence spell. It will repair the vocal
cords of the target, making audiable speech possible once again. Note that you
must be able to speak to cast this spell in the first place, so those affected
by silence must find another person to cure them.

Syntax:
cast remove-silence <target>
