The wall of fire spell will summon a barrier of flames, blocking an exit. The
wall of fire will also block the exit in the target room that leads back to
the room you are in, if one could be found. Anyone, besides the caster, who
passes through the wall of fire will take fire damage. A wall of fire may be
brought down by a dispel-magic spell.

Syntax:
cast wall-of-fire <exit>
