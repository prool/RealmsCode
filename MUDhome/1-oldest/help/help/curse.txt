This spell may be used by a mage or lich to curse an item in their
inventory. Despite common misconceptions, cursing a weapon is not always
bad. For example, you will be unable to fumble your weapon if it is placed
under a curse. However, evil wizards can decide to curse defective items to
spread among the populace, causing general mayhem. You must be level 16 or
higher to cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast curse <object>
