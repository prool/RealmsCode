This spell renders a person somewhat protected against all all undead. When
under this spell, a person will not be attacked by aggro undead. They also will
never be casted on by undead monsters of any kind. While under this spell, a
person takes half damage from any undead's attack forms. This includes players
as well as monsters. If a monster has this spell cast on them, an undead
player's spells do half damage to it. For player vs player, undead casters do
half damage as well. Only clerics and paladins may ever cast this spell, but
not clerics of Aramon.

Syntax:
