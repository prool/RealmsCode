The hide command allows you to hide yourself or objects that are in the room.
If you type hide by itself, you will attempt to hide in the shadows to prevent
other players or monsters from seeing you in the room. You can also attempt to
hide any object that is sitting on the room's floor, and if you are successful
the object will not be visible to anyone who does not search for it. Rangers,
thieves and assassins hide best.

Example:
: hide hoe
You attempt to hide it.
You tuck a hoe into a corner.
: hide
You attempt to hide in the shadows.
You slip into the shadows unnoticed.
