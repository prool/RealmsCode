All the savage and less civilized races of Derlith must have spiritual guidance,
primitive as it may be. Tribal shamans fill this roll. Acting as both
witchdoctors and healers, they are savage fighters and also are able to command
magical powers, some of a powerful nature. A shaman has the ability to chant
before battle, inciting a mild battle frenzy in members of his tribe. He is also
able to mix and brew substances together to make concoctions of almost any sort
- some being poisons and others being magical potions or having other effects.
Other abilities of shaman aren't know very well, as most of the savage tribes
are somewhat elusive and cryptic.
