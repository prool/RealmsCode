   Can anyone verify that bloodboil for darkelves has actually been added
   to the game? I know the spot in Oakspire where it is supposed to be. Two
   golems guarding the door, but the key you get from Asher doesn't work. 
   I know that some updates created problems with keys, and I am just
   wondering if this is something like that, or just that you have to get
   the key somewhere else entirely. Thoughts?
