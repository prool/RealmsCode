Heat-protection is a spell which will protect you from firey breath of monsters
and fire-damaging rooms. An invisibile, intangible shield surrounding the target
will absorb some of the damage inflicted upon them from the previous sources,
but keep in mind: it does NOT protect the target from fire-based spells.

Syntax:
cast heat-protection <target>
