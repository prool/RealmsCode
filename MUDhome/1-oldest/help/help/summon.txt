This spell summons its target to the room of the caster, summoning him across an
infinite stretch of land. Note that natural occurances often interfere with the
summon spell, most often in underground or magical locations. The target must
have also set the SUMMON flag for this spell to work.

Mages, liches, and clerics may cast the summon spell starting at 7th level; all
other classes must wait until 10th level. Below 15th level, a character may have
difficulty summoning more powerful players.

Syntax:
cast summon <target>
