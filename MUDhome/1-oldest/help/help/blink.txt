This spell allows the caster to blink away to an exit, guaranteeing
successfull fleeing, as well as leaving enemies with no clue as to which
exit he/she fled to. This spell is class restrictive, and it will not allow
a caster to blink to exits they normally could not flee to. For example,
you cannot blink into a full room, or blink through a closed door or past
exit-guarding creatures.

Only mages and liches may cast this spell.

Syntax:
: c blink east
You cast a blink spell! You blink away to the east.
