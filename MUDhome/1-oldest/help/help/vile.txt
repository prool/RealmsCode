Gradius considers the following races vile: orcs, ogres, goblins, trolls, and
kobolds. When a cleric or paladin of Gradius kills a creature belonging to one
of these races, the resulting alignment shift will only be beneficial. Gradius
requires his followers to remain close to neutral, which previously meant
killing too many orcs would push Gradius into good and throw off his alignment.
However, because the alignment change will only help a cleric or paladin of
Gradius, this is no longer the case.

For example, an evil cleric of Gradius kills an evil orc. Her alignment will
move towards good. Once it reaches neutral, however, the cleric's alignment
will stop changing; it will not progress further to good. If the evil cleric
of Gradius were to kill good vile monsters, her alignment would remain the
same, rather than being pushed further into evil.
