Room-vigor is a variation of the vigor spell, but can only be cast by clerics.
It effectively casts a vigor spell on every person in the room, healing them
slightly. The MP cost of the spell is the same regardless of the number of
people in the room, so it is more effective when cast on large groups of people.

Syntax:
cast room-vigor
