This spell improves your ability to hit monsters. It fills the target with
holy perception, whether good, neutral, or evil, and allows them to plan
their blows more carefully. Thus, with the help of a diety, it is more
likely they will make contact with their weapon when attacking.

Syntax:
cast bless <target>
