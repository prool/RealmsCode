This spell surrounds you with a magical shield of protective magic. It's effect
is to absorb half the damage of any spell cast at you and reflect that damage
back to the caster. So if you are icebladed for 60 damage, 30 will be reflected
back and you will take only 30. Rebound magic will reflect two-thirds of
offensive spells cast against you. It is also cumulative with the resist spells.
Note that rebound-magic has a chance to reflect a stun back at whomever casts it.

Syntax:
cast rebound-magic <target>
