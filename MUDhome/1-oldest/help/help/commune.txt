This ability allows a druid of sufficient level to commune with nature in
order to detect any living creatures in the rooms around him/her. It does
not detect elemental pets or undead creatures. It will detect hidden
creatures and players. It will not see rooms beyond hidden or concealed
exits, nor will it see beyond closed doors.
