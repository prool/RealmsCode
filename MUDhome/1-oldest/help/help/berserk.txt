Berserk is a ability used by berserkers giving them strength during its
duration. It allows them to hit for around 1.5x the normal hit and gives
them +5 strength temporarily. Note that while berserked, a berserker will
be unable to flee from combat.

The death knight equivalent of berserk is pray.
