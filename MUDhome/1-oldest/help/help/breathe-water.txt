This spell allows its target to breath under water safely. It polymorphs
the lungs of the target into a gill/lung combination, allowing them to
breathe both air and water. Only slight discomfort is experienced, though,
and the lungs revert to their normal make-up when the spell expires.

Syntax:
cast breathe-water <target>
