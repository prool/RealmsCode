The speak command allows a player to set their current language they are
speaking in. If you do not know a specific language, you cannot speak it. You
may type LANGUAGES to see what languages you are able to speak, as well as what
you are speaking currently.

Example:
: speak elven
You will now speak in elven.
: speak comm
You will now speak in common.
