With the auction command, players can auction off items in their inventory
for the rest of the mud to buy. Just list the item to be auctioned and how
much it goes for. Note there is a minimum price of 500gp, and you must be
visisble to auction. You must be atleast level 7 to auction. If you are
under detect-magic, then magic properties will be broadcast to the mud as
well.

Syntax:
   auction (item)[which|#num] $(amount) [each|total]
   auction self $(amount)
