For help on non-PK alignment, type HELP ALIGNMENTHELP.

This command allows a player to choose their alignment path after a certain
level. Players must choose to follow law or chaos. The alignments are
described as below:


^WLaw:^x
Lawful players cannot steal or kill other players, and they cannot be
killed or stolen from by other players. A pledged lawful player, or a
paladin / deathknight, may still attack other players. Using the who
command, lawful players show up with an ^yL^x preceding their name.

^WChaos:^x
Chaotic players can kill and steal from other chaotic players, and they
also can be stolen from and killed by other chaotic players. If you do not
know the game well, it is advised you do not be chaotic. This is
recommended for advanced players only. Using the who command, chaotic
players show up with an ^yL^x preceding their name.

^WNeutral:^x
When a chaotic player enters a room where player-killing is not allowed,
the player will show up as neutral using the who command. This is indicated
by an ^yN^x preceding their name.

Note that it is possible to duel with other players using the DUEL command.
HELP DUEL for more details. It is also possible to join a player run guild
whether you are lawful or chaotic.

To convert to Law after choosing Chaos, see the HELP CONVERT file.

Example:

Syntax: alignment lawful

Note: Tieflings must be chaotic.
