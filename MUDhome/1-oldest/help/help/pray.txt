Pray is a skill given to clerics and paladins which will allow them every 10
minutes or so to pray to their god(s) for additional piety. If granted, the
player will have extra piety for about 5 minutes or so.  This means that the
player will heal faster and be attacked less by monsters during that time.

Deathknight pray is similar to berserk. Instead of raising piety, it increases
the strength of the deathknight.
