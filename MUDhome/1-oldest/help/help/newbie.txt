Newbie is a command which may be used to broadcast to the newbie channel.
Everyone can see this channel. It is possible to disable seeing this channel by
typing "clear newbie". It can be re-enabled by typing "set newbie".

Newbie is only able to be used up through level 4. Beyond that level, it is
unable to be used.

Note that abuse of the newbie channel is considered a general infraction against
the policy (HELP POLICY).

Example:
: newbie hi!
[Newbie]: *** Bob just sent, "hi!"
