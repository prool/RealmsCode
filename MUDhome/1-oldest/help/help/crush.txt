This spell is a powerful spell in the earth realm. It creates a collection
of earth that crushes the target as the caster directs. The spell can often
result in broken bones and other abrasions, though it is unlikely the
target will be killed unless it is weak in health. However, the spell can
become quite formidable in the hands of a powerful mage.

Syntax:
cast crush <target>
