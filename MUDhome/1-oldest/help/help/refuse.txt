Refuse allows you to create a "refuse list" similar to your ignore list and gag
list (HELP IGNORE, HELP GAG). When someone is on your refuse list, they cannot
follow you, and they cannot give you items. This list is cleared every time you
log off/on.

Refuse also allows you to prevent people from casting certain spells on you.
You may only refuse non-combat, benefitial spells, such as healing spells, blur,
enlarge, or resist-magic.

Syntax:
refuse <target>
