This is an ability granted only to Clerics of Gradius. Upon reaching the proper
level, it allows the cleric to smother a target with earth. Resist-earth or
resist-magic halves the damage and grants an additional saving throw. The higher
level the cleric, the more damage the attack has potential to do.

Example:
: smoth win
You smothered the wino for 10 damage.
You killed the wino.
You gained 6 experience for the death of the wino.
