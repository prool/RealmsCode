This is the third level spell in the fire realm. As the name says, the
spell shoots a burst of flame at the target, engulfing it in fire and
burning it rather severely. The spell is made slightly more lethal by the
fact it will ignite clothes, doing more damage and causing grave burns.

Syntax:
cast burstflame <target>
