AOE (area-of-effect) spells are spells that can damage multiple targets.
Each elemental realm has a single AOE spell associated with it. To be able
to cast an AOE spell, you must be high enough level to cast a 5th tier
spell.

The caster of an AOE spell can target monsters, players, or both. Note that
for the purpose of this spell, all pets will be treated as players. Thus,
targeting the monsters in the room will skip all pets, and targeting the
players in a room will also target pets. An AOE spell does damage similar
to that of a 2nd tier spell.

Syntax:
cast spell [<monsters>|<players>|<all>]
