The cast command allows you to cast spells which you may have learned by
studying scrolls (help study). The "spells" command will tell you which
spells you currently know. Different spells cost different amounts of magic
points. When you cast a spell, the magic points are subtracted, and the
special magic effect is produced. Unlike other MUDs, this one allows all
classes to cast spells. Of course, some classes get more magic points than
others. To cast a spell on yourself, do not include a target.

Shortcuts

A couple spells have casting shortcuts to make casting them quicker and
easier. For example, you can type "c d-i" as a shortcut for "cast
detect-invisibility".

Example:
: c v
Vigor spell cast.
: c ench hoe
The hoe (+2) begins to glow brightly.
