Darkmetal is essentially an item trait that makes it vulnerable to
sunlight. This is common on drow weapons, which can reach enchantments of
+4 and +5. However, such items require careful attention.

Your darkmetal items are safe if:

    * It is night
    * You are in Limbo or the Origin
    * The room you are in is always dark / magically dark
    * The room you are in is indoors / underground
    * The room you are in is not on this plane of existence (ie, Ethereal
      Plane)
    * Your darkmetal item is in a bag

If your darkmetal item is not safe, it will be destroyed the instant it
is exposed to sunlight.
