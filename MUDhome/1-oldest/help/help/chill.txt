This lowly spell causes a chill which drains body temperature abrubtly,
harming the target through system-shock. Generally most creatures' nerves
are vulnerable to such sudden changes in the temperate, though creatures
innately immune to cold will only suffer minor wounds.

Syntax:
cast chill <target>
