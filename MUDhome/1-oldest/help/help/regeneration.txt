The regeneration spell temporarily grants the target a magical means of
recovering from wounds, increasing their natural rate of healing. A
character under the regeneration spell will heal more quickly than normal.
If the target of the spell is being affected by festering wounds, the
regeneration spell will expend itself to heal the wounds.

This spell cannot be cast on the undead. Only druids and clerics may
cast this spell.

Syntax:
