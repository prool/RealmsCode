This spell causes a magical panic to be instilled in the target which causes
them to flee whenever hit, no matter for how little damage. You cannot cast this
spell on yourself. In order to do that, you must drink a potion which causes the
spell effect. If cast on a monster, it causes the monster to flee when hit.
Permanent monsters are unaffected by this spell, and paladins are immune to both
this spell and potions with its effect. This spell can be casted on lawfuls.

Syntax:
cast fear <target>
