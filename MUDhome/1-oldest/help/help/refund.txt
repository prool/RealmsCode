This command allows you to refund an item in a shop which you just purchased.
You will receive back full gold. Items are refundable so long as you do not
leave the room with them or use them in any way. This includes logging off/on
with them. There are NO REFUNDS in player run shops.

If an item is used in ANY way, including bard identify, the item is used, and
it will not be refunded.

Syntax: refund (item) [#]
