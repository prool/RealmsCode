Dark elves, or Drow as they are sometimes called, are the ancient cousins
of elves who were banished to the underworld for practicing evil magics and
worshiping dark gods. Occasionally, one of these dark elves will wander to
the surface of Derlith to live instead. These rogue dark elves never have a
place in society and are shunned and often attacked by other elves of the
surface. As a result, they often become criminals, living as thieves,
assassins, or something equally bad. The dark elf's small and slender form
and long fingers gives him a fighting edge in addition to helping him in
matters of stealth. A dark elf is thus very agile. However, thousands of
years under the surface of the world in darkness has rendered him not as
strong as some surface races.
