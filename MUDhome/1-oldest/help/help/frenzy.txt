Frenzy allows a werewolf to attack in a maddened whirlwind of claws and teeth.
It makes them harder to hit, in addition to increasing their dexterity by five.
A werewolf which is frenzied attacks every two seconds instead of every three.
It can be used once every 10 minutes, and it only lasts for 2 minutes.

Example:
: frenz
