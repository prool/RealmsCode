Kobolds are small dog-faced creatures which live in hills and low mountain
regions underground. They are usually quite clever in large numbers, and they
are often the bane of many halfling or gnome settlements in hilly areas all
across Derlith. Kobolds are tribal in nature, and each community population
often numbers in the thousands. They breed like rabbits. Dwarves cannot stand
them, and they often have "Kobold tossing" events at parties or clan get
togethers. Kobolds can live in any but the most terrible filth, so they are
quite robust for their size. In addition, they are also pretty nimble, making
excellent thieves. Due to their small size, however, they suffer from lack of
strength much like halflings.
