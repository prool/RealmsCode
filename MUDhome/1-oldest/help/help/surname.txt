This command will allow a player of high enough level to give themselves a
surname (last name). Characters ' and - are both allowed. All surnames must be
at least 3 characters long, and they cannot be longer than 14. Once a surname
is set, it is set forever. A confirmation of (Y/N) is given whenever you try to
choose one.

Note that profane or idiotic surnames, as well as idiotic or profane
combinations of name and surname, will not be tolerated. If you violate this,
you will never be allowed to choose a surname again.
