The fiery-retribution spell will surround the target in a shield of magical
flames, flaring up and burning an enemy whenever the target is struck by
physical melee damage (bows and thrown weapons do not trigger this spell).
The damage to the attacker does not vary based on how much damage is dealt.

Syntax:
cast fiery-retribution <target>
