Upon reaching a high enough level, Paladins are infused by the power of Enoch in
such a way that they may lay their hands upon someone to heal them. The amount
healed is based upon the paladin's level. This will not work on undead at all,
and it has daily limitations, a time limitation, and also alignment restrictions.
