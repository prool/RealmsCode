Player shops can be associated with a guild by using the ^yshop guild assign^x
command. This has two main effects:

  1. All guild members become partial owners of this shop. This allows them
     to stock items (but not to unstock).
  2. All profits from the shop are deposited into the guild's bank account.

Ownership of the shop remains with the player who purchased the shop, not the
guild. If the player is removed from the guild, the shop will be as well.
Shops built inside the guild foyer are an exception: ownership will remain
with the guildmaster, just like the guild hall.

You may use the ^yshop guild remove^x command to unassign a shop from a guild.

For further information about guilds, please type ^yHELP GUILDS^x.
