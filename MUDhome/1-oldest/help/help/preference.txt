These three commands will allow you to change you preferences. To view a
list of your preferences, simply type any one of them by itself. The
"preference" command acts as "toggle" when given a specific preference.

Some notes:

For information on the "lagprotect" and "lagrecall" preference, type
"help lagprotect".

It is recommended you leave the "summon" preference off until you need to turn
it on it. It prevents other players from moving your character across the
world without your permission.
