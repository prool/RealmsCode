This spell is a decent spell in the wind realm. Gusts of wind will fly from
the caster's hands, knocking the target to its feet and striking it with
anything nearby that is not bolted down. Broken bones may sometimes result,
although they are not entirely common.

Syntax:
cast dustgust <target>
