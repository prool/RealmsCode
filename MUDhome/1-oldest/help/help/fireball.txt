This is a powerful spell in the fire realm, turning the air infront of the
target to fire and hurling the flaming mass at the target. The recipient of
this spell is often badly burned, though will usually survive unless other means
are used. However, fireball is a fairly strong spell used by the less
experienced mages.

Syntax:
cast fireball <target>
