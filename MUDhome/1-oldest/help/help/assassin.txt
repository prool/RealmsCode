The assassin is the cold warrior of the night. He moves in shadow, stalking
his prey. Assassins have the ability to backstab their opponents, doing
massive damage in one blow by attacking in surprise from the shadows.
Assassins can hide better then most, and they often can sneak from place to
place without being seen. Due to there slippery nature, assassins are able
to dodge attacks on occasion. The ability gets better the more powerful
they become. The assassin may also scout for his potential prey, keeping
himself out of danger while he does so. An assassin can be so murderous and
diabolical, that they will often envenom their blades to kill their victims
long after they strike and fade into the shadows. At higher levels, they
owe allegiance to the dark courts of Caladon, as well as several dark
organizations across Derlith.
