Dispel magic can be cast only by a mage, lich, cleric, or druid. If done
from a wand or scroll or potion, anyone can cast it. It cannot be cast in
a tic room. By casting it on yourself or a target, you dispel ALL yours or
the target's time duration spells. Keep in mind that there is a chance of
failure if cast on another  player, depending on certain variables.

Syntax:
cast dispel-magic <target>
