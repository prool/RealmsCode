A simple function that lets you compare two weapons or two pieces of armor
and see which one is better.  If you only pass one argument it will attempt
to compare the item with currently equiped items.

Syntax: compare <item 1> [Item 2]

Example:
: comp fireb staff
The fireblade (+1) seems ^rworse^x than the fire staff (+3).
: comp staff fireb
The fire staff (+3) seems ^gbetter^x than the fireblade (+1).
