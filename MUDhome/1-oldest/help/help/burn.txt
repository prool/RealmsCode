This spell is the lowest level spell in the fire realm. It scorches the
target and creates minor burns on the target's skin. Though most of these
wounds are not fatal, repeated burns can be lethal. However, the spell is
generally used to irritate and provoke rather than kill.

Syntax:
cast burn <target>
