This spell allows its target to detect magical items and monsters by
connecting the target's eyes to a magical plane. Magic items will glow a
soft blue, denoted by a nummerical plus or a (M). Spell-casting monsters
will also be noted with a (M). This spell can be used to identify many
magic items as well as prepare for an assault against a spell-casting
creatute. Note that, while the majority of magic items can be identified
via this spell, it is not possible on all items.
