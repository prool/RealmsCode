Half elves are the result of the crossing of elves and humans. As a result, they
often have no place to call a home, as neither side accepts them fully. Half
elves living with humans fair better however, as elves tend to be a bit more
racist then mankind. A half elf inherits his elven half's quick intellect as
well as his smallness of stature. Half elves are able to become masters at any
profession, and they can be found all across Derlith.
