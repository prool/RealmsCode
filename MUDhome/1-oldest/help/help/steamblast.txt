This is the third level spell in the water realm. It causes a sprout of boiling
steam to engulf the target, burning all exposed skin and finding its way into
the crevices of any armor. The spell deals a fair amount of damage to those
not resistant to the water realm.

Syntax:
cast steamblast <target>
