The prepare command is used when you know the next room you're going to walk
into has a trap in it. If you prepare before entering a room, you have a much
higher chance of avoid any trap in that room (unless your dexterity is really
poor). Prepare only lasts until you enter the next room, and you can only use
it once every 15 seconds.

Example:
: prep
You prepare yourself for traps.

You may also use the prepare command on an object. This identifies which
objects you wish to use when creating a new item. Type ^WHELP CRAFT^x for more
information on creating items.

Example:
: prepare yeast
You prepare the yeast.
