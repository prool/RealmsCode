The enfeeblement spell decreases your strength, making you weaker and causing
you to perform tasks less efficiently. This spell does not last long, but while
it is in effect, you will do more less in combat. An enfeeblement spell
counteracts the effects of a strength spell.

An enfeeblement spell will cancel out the berserk ability or a deathknight's
pray ability. Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast enfeeblement <target>
