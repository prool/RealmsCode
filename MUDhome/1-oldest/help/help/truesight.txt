True-sight will allow a player to detect misted vampires. It is similar to
detect-invisiblility, other then it doesn't detect invisiblity, it detects mist.
With true-sight, a player can attack a vampire with spells, turning, and any
other types of attacks which are non-physical. Players still see vampires as
traveling as mists, and the vampire can still sneak. However, they are no longer
invincible when players have this spell cast.

Syntax:
cast true-sight <target>
