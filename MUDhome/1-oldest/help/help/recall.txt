For players level seven and under, this command will recall you to your
starting room provided that you are not in combat.

For players over level seven, or if you are in combat this command will 
search through your inventory  for a hazy potion (rather, any potion with
the  word-of-recall spell) and make  you drink it. The potion can be 
anywhere on your  person; it can be in a bag, you can be holding it, or you 
can be holding a bag with the potion in it.
