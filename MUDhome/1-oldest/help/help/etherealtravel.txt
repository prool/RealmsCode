At times it may be necessary to travel to the ethereal plane, an area of flux
between dimensions touching every single point in the universe. To do this you
would cast this spell. This spell may be cast on others whether chaotic or
lawful. However, one must be 13th level in order to control the magic needed to
do this. Be forewarned..the ethereal plane can be a dangerous place for novices
and thrillseekers alike. Be warned. Hazy potions and other similar items do not
work the same from  the etheral plane, as the magic there is different then in
the normal world.
