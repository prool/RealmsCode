This spell is a fearsome spell that can utterly destroy a target. If the
target fails their saving throw, they will be killed instantly. Even on
failure, the target will lose half their hit points and be stunned. Note
that killing a monster via this spell will not give you any experience and
will destroy any items they were carrying.

Beware of shoplifting in Igmoo's store, for he knows this spell!

Syntax:
