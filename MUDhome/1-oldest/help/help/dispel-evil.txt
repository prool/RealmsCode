This spell allows paladins and clerics (not Aramon or Arachnus clerics
though) to do damage to evil players and creatures. Damage is based on the
caster's level and piety. You must be good aligned to cast this it. Against
summoned evil creatures, it is especially good. Note that there are other
summoned creatures which are evil besides the dead creatures Aramon clerics
are able to animate.

Syntax:
cast dispel-evil <target>
