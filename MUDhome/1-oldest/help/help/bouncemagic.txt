This spell surrounds you with a magical shield of protective magic. It's
effect is to absorb half the damage of any spell cast at you and reflect
that damage back to the caster. So if you are icebladed for 60 damage, 30
will be reflected back and you will take only 30. Bounce magic will reflect
one-third of offensive spells cast against you. It is also cumulative with
the resist spells. Note that bounce-magic has a chance to reflect a stun
back at whomever casts it.

Syntax:
cast bounce-magic <target>
