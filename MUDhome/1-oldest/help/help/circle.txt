The circle command allows fighters and berserkers to run circles about an
opponent, causing them to be confused for several seconds. Any monster that
is circled will not be able to attack back for a few seconds, giving you a
slight defensive advantage. Circle is most useful in groups.

Example:
: cir win
You circle the wino.
: cir win
You failed to circle it.
