The lottery has returned! It has taken a new form now. Once a week (Sunday
nights), five huge dice are rolled, and the results are recorded. After that,
another big die is rolled, called the Powerbone. When you purchase a Powerbone
ticket, it has 5 random numbers and a random Powerbone number. Depending on your
combination of guessed numbers with or without the Powerbone, you can win cash
by claiming your ticket. If your ticket matches all five numbers, as well as
the Powerbone, you will win the grand jackpot!

You can use the LOTTERYINFO command in order to see what the current numbers
are, as well as the amount of the jackpot. If no one wins the jackpot, the pot
rises slowly over time.

When the numbers are drawn, and you have a winning ticket, you may procede to
any nearby lottery office and use the CLAIM command in order to collect your
prize money! Only one person can ever win the jackpot. It is not divided.
Powerbone tickets are only good for the current lottery cycle.

Powerbone tickets have a bulk rating of 3. They are unable to be dropped or
traded to anybody else. Tickets can never be bought on the day of the drawing.

The winnings are caculated as follows:
0 numbers and Powerbone...................500gp
2 numbers.................................1000gp
1 number and Powerbone....................3000gp
2 numbers and Powerbone...................7000gp
3 numbers ................................7000gp

4 numbers.................................10000gp

The lottery command will show you all information about the current lottery
cycle. This includes the numbers which were drawn, the time of the next
drawing, and the current jackpot.
