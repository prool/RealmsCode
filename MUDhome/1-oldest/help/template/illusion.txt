The illusion spell disguises the target as another race. Note that this does
not give the target the ability to speak or understand the language of that
race. All players will perceive the target as the given race. Note that this
will also affect faction - an elf illusioned as a dark-elf will not be
attacked on sight.

Syntax:
cast illusion <target> <race>

Illusion spells deceive the minds of others. They cause people to see
things that are not there, hear noises that are not there, or fail to see
things that are there.

Note that the illusion school currently has limited spells. More work
is being done to code spells for this school.
