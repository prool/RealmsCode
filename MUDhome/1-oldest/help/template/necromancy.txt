Necromancy spells manipulate the power of life and death. They raise the
dead to fight for the caster and steal the life force of the enemy.
Spells that protect from the undead belong to the school of Abjuration.

Note that the necromancy school currently has limited spells. More work
is being done to code spells for this school.

Note: You must be evil to cast necromancy spells.
