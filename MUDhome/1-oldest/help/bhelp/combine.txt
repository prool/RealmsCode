Help on:
	recipe creation with *combine and *set rec

Use *recipe to view recipes you can edit.

To create a new recipe, use the prepare command to prepare the different
items in your inventory. Set one of the fields: ingredients, reusables,
or equipment, by typing

	*combine ingredients new

	ingredients: will be consumed in the creation of the item
	reusables: items that will not be consumed
	equipment: items in room, also will not be consumed

	For items to work in this list, they must have atleast 1 shot
	and must be set to full shots (no used items). Bags used as
	ingredients must be completely empty (0 current shots).

This will create a new recipe for you and give you an ID number. To edit
one of these fields in the future, type

	*combine ingredients #

Type "*set rec" by itself to see a list of parameters you are able to set
on a recipe. The syntax is:

	*set rec # result #
