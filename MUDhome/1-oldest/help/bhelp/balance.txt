Help on: *balance

This command is used to simplify the building of monsters.
It is the only way someone less then CT status is able to
make and modify certain stats, as they are not allowed to
*set certain things. Monsters can be balanced either normal,
weak, or buff, depending on which switch you use or lack
thereof. Most stats are based around *dmh guide, but in some
cases this was deviated from. Please use this whenever
possible, as it should greatly improve game balance.
Syntax:
*balance <monster> <level#> [-w | -b]

Example:
: You see a Highport Guardsman.
: *balance high 20 -w
: The Highport guardsman is now balanced at level 20.
: The Highport guardsman was balanced with weak stats.
: *balance high 10
: The Highport guardsman is now balanced at level 10.
: The Highport guardsman was balanced with average stats.
: *balance high 15 -b
: The Highport guardsman is now balanced at level 15.
