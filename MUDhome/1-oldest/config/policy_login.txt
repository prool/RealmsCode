These infractions are by all means not all inclusive. There
are surely some things not listed here which will likely be
considered by the staff as against the rules. Just because
something isn't listed here, does not mean it will be ok for
you to do it. Please use common sense. Staff members have
final word here on what is and is not to be considered an
infraction. If you have questions please mail a watcher.
