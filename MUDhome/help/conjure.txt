Druids and clerics of Gradius may invoke elementals to help them during battles,
though clerics of Gradius are restricted to earth elementals. The strength of
the elemental is dependent on the title of the caster; as the caster gains
experience, so do their "pets". The length of time a pet will stay around is
dependant on the player; if the player is a cleric, it depends on piety, but
if the player is a druid, it will depend on piety OR constitution, whichever is
higher.

Bards and mages, and some other classes possibly, also are able to cast this
spell if they find it. They each receive different kinds of pets.

Syntax:
