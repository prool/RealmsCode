The weakness spell decreases your constitution, making you sickly and less
resistant to poison and disease. This spell does not last long, but while it is
in effect, you will have less hitpoints. A weakness spell counteracts the
effects of a fortitude spell. This spell cannot be cast on undead.

A weakness spell will cancel out the berserk ability.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast weakness <target>
