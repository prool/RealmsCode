Half giants are a strange race, a magical cross between humans and hill giants.
Standing often nine or ten feet tall, half giants have very brute strength. Half
giants often live as barbarian gladiators and body guards, and usually learn to
fight at a very young age. There are many special armors and weapons which are
only usable by half giants, as any other being is too small of stature or weak
to wear or wield them. Half giants tend to be a little more dull witted in
general, and they are not very pious, owing mostly to their giantkin roots.
Some half giants become very good assassins, but this is rare due to their
large size.
