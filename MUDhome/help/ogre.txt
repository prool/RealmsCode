Ogres are ancient cousins of giants. They are big and very ugly, standing often
between seven and eight feet tall. Tribes of ogres can be found in the mountains
and sometimes in remote hilly areas. Ogres are very strong, a trait which they
get from their relation to giants. They aren't very pious though, often caring
more about when their next raid will be then anything else. Ogres make very good
barbarians or fighters, and this is often what they become. Since they have a
tendency to eat human flesh, they are not well tolerated by mankind. As a result
they are often shunned by civilized areas.
