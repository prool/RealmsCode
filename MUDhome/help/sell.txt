You may only sell things you have in a pawn shop. You may sell any item you
have that is not broken or worthless. To find out how much money the pawn
shopkeeper will give you an item before you actually sell it, use the VALUE
command. Also note that pawn shops will not buy potions, no matter how valuable
they are.

Example:
: sell hoe
The shopkeep says, "I won't buy that crap from you."
: sell gold
The shopkeep gives you 50 gold for the golden bauble.
