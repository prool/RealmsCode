Races can each speak different languages. In order to see which languages your
character is able to speak, type LANGUAGES. This will also tell you what you are
currently speaking. People in the room who do not speak the language you are
speaking cannot understand what you are saying.

Currently, there is no method for learning new languages. It is based on race
alone. In the future this may change, but not for right now.

To change between languages, you use the "speak" command. HELP SPEAK for more
information.

Languages show up in colors. If you find these colors irritating, and you wish
to not see them, simply type "clear langcolor", and the colors will go away.
