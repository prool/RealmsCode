This spell causes a massive bolt of electricty and sound to slam into the
target, knocking them back. A thunderclap goes off in the immediate area,
slamming harmfully into the target's eardrums, sometimes causing them to bleed
out of their ears. In addition, the target is often killed due to massive
electrical burns and nervous system disruption.

Syntax:
cast thunderbolt <target>
