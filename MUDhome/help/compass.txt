Compass objects help you navigate the overland. Each compass is attuned to
a specific location. When you are traveling on the overland, the compass will
tell you the general direction and distance to where it is attuned. You may
buy compasses from general stores / pawn shops all around Derlith.

If you hold or wear the compass, it will print to the screen whenever you
walk or type "look".
