This command allows you to see who or what all is following you and you are
following. It also allows you to see the current hit points and magic points of
everyone/everything in your group. If a group member is hurt, their hit points
appear in red. If you have the know aura spell cast upon you, or if you're a
paladin, you will see the aura of each member of your group as blue for good,
normal for neutral, and red for evil. You will not see these colors if you
have SET NOCOLOR.

If you do not want your hit points and magic points displayed to your group,
type SET NOSTATS.
