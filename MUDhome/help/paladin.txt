The paladin is a holy warrior of a god, the crusader of all that is righteous
and just. A paladin can be so strong in his faith that it gives him power
against his enemies in combat, making his attacks do more damage then normal.
He may also turn back evil creatures of the undead with his faith, sometimes
just harming them but other times destroying them utterly. A paladin is always
able to determine the evil or good nature of those around him. Also, paladins
of extreme faith and power are able to lay hands on people to heal them almost
to full health three times per day. The nemesis of the paladin is the Death
Knight, a blatant creation of evil and a mockery of his faith. Paladins may
renounce a Death Knight with the martial strength of their faith to harm them.
A paladin normally attacks a Death Knight on sight in order to send the
creature to Hell where it belongs.
