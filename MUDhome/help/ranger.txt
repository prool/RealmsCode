The ranger is the protector of the forest and guardian of nature. His goal is
the destruction of all that seeks to harm nature, and to thwart all that is an
affront to it. A ranger is an excellent scout, able to search ahead of his
companions without being seen. He may also search the ground and find common
routes of travel by finding tracks, making him an invaluable asset when trying
to escape areas such as mazes. Rangers search better then most, making them the
best explorers in all of Derlith. Last but not least, the ranger is an excellent
fighter, being able to wield a weapon in each hand when he attacks. The most
common enemy of a ranger is any undead, creatures of which he despises as a
mockery to all that is natural. To this end, rangers of Derlith have been known
to become some of the best vampire hunters that have ever lived. They are the
only ones known to be able to detect the foul creatures at night. Rangers are
known to hunt liches as well at times.
