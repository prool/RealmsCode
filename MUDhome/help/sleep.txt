When injured, players may go to sleep to heal faster then normal. While
sleeping, you will gain three more hit points and magic points than normal.
A character is very vulnerable while they are sleeping; they are 50% easier to
hit and will take twice the amount of damage from an attack. Players are also
unconscious during this time, meaning they are generally unaware of their
surroundings.

Combat and loud noises will prevent a character from sleeping, and several
socials will wake a sleeping character. Note that you are allowed to hide
before your sleep, providing you some secrecy until shifting shadows expose
you. When you are completely healed, you will awaken automatically.

Vampires may only sleep during the day, and then only where there is no
sunlight. At night, their thirst for blood keeps them awake. Liches, being
undead creatures, are unable to sleep.
