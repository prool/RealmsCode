The ignore command allows you to ignore flashes (sends, tells) from other
players in the game. If typed without an argument, the list of people you are
ignoring will be displayed. If typed with a player's name, that player will be
added to your ignore list if he or she is not already on it. Otherwise the name
is removed from the list.

Example:
: ignore bob
Bob added to your ignore list.
: ignore bob
Bob removed from your ignore list.
