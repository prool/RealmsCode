Turn is a special ability that is given to paladins and some clerics. When
attacking undead creatures (like ghosts, vampires, etc.) a cleric or paladin
may try to turn a monster. If successful, the monster is stripped of half its
hit points or possibly even killed instantly. This is a powerful weapon. Success
depends on the difference in levels between the player and monster as well as
piety.
