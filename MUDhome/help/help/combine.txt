Combine and craft are two commands related to item creation. You may use the in
two ways:

1. Use the prepare command and prepare the relative items in your inventory.
   Type "combine" or "craft", and if a combination is possible, a new item
   will be created.

2. Use the combine or craft command on a recipe - "craft <object>" - and
   you will follow the recipe and create a new object.
