The damnation spell condemns you in the eyes of your deity, decreasing your
piety. This spell does not last long, but while it is in effect, you will have
less mana. A prayer spell counteracts the effects of a damnation spell.

A damnation spell will cancel out the effects of clerical pray.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast damnation <target>
