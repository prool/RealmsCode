This spell causes its target to blend into surroundings, making sneaking and
hiding easier in outdoor areas, in addition to making it harder for a ranger to
track you. Camouflage works especially well for druids in any kind of jungle /
forest, as it gives greater bonuses for them for sneak and hide, and as long as
the druid remains in the forest, the spell will not wear off.

Syntax:
cast camouflage <target>
