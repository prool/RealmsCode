This is a supernatural ability of higher level werewolves which allows them to
let out a blood-curdling and terrifying howl. All creatures of low enough levels
in the room which are the werewolf's enemy will either flee in terror or be
stunned if they fail a saving throw. This ability is timed, and can can only be
used every so often.

Example:
: howl
You let out a blood-curdling supernatural howl!
The wino flees in terror to the south!
The 2nd wino is frozen in terror!
