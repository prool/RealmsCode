If you are in a shop, you may purchase an item for sale with the buy command.
First use the LIST command to see what is for sale, and then purchase it with
this command. Please note that when you use the buy command only the word that
directly follows it is interpreted, so if you typed "buy leather boots," it
would not care what followed the word "leather". This could cause you pain if
there were several leather items for sale, because "buy leather" will buy you
the first leather item on the list. To avoid this problem, either use "buy
boots" or "buy leather 2" where leather boots is the second leather item for
sale.

You may also use the buy command to purchase items from monsters who sell
things.

To buy from a player store, you must type # before the item number. For
example, "buy #26".
