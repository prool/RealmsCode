The fighter is a master of weapons and fighting arts. He travels from place to
place to do battle in armies as a vassal or as a mercenary. The more powerful
fighters are masters of the lands around them. Fighters may circle their
enemies in attacks, confusing them for many seconds before moving in to strike.
Like barbarians, fighters are also able to bash their opponents senseless with
force of strength. In addition, they are able to kick their enemies in combat
as an augmentation to their fighting skills with weapons. Fighters are also
able to disarm their opponents, depriving their enemies of their weapons in
order to have a better advantage. At higher levels, the fighter of high
intelligence is able to cast some spells to help him fight. There are several
clans throughout Derlith in which a fighter may join - most often those
opposing thieves and assassins.
