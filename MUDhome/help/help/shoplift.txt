If you find you do not wish to pay excessive amounts of gold in a shop for any
particular item, it is possible to shoplift that item. Anyone can do this, but
naturally some classes are better then others (thieves obviously having the best
chance). Also, keep in mind that heavier items are much harder to get out of the
store, thus are harder to shoplift. If you fail and are caught, most likely you
will be attacked by one ore more enemies, and you will be banned from the shop
for a time in order to avoid death - but it's SO MUCH FUN to try, isn't it?
Note: Casting classes (druid, mage, lich, cleric) are not very cut out for this,
and paladins flat out can't do it.
