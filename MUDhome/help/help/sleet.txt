This third level spell causes sleet to erupt from the caster's hands, sending
small ice slivers to cut the target, and it covers them with a coat of harmful
frost. The body's reaction the to freezing rain is often devastating, hampering
movment due to the frigidness of the spell.

Syntax:
cast sleet <target>
