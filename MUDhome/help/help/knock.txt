MP cost: varies

This spell allows the caster to send magic into locked portals, magically
unlocking them. Some locked exits are more fortified by others, be it by magic,
or complexity of the lock mechanism. As such, these may be harder to use knock
on, and it will cost more MP to cast the spell. Standard MP cost starts with
10MP and goes up from there, depending on difficulty of the lock, and the class
of the caster.

Only mages, liches, and bards may cast this spell.

Example:
: c knock door
You cast a knock spell on the "door" exit.
Click! Your knock spell was successful!
: c knock double
You cast a knock spell on the "double doors" exit.
Your knock spell failed.
