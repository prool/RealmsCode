The monk is the silent warrior of martial arts. With his hands alone, he is able
to harm his enemies using ancient techniques of fighting known only to his
order. Very few weapons, however, are made specifically for monks in order for
them to fight creatures of a magical nature. To regain his strength, a monk may
enter a meditative trance while fighting. A monk may also concentrate to focus
his mental energy on his opponent. This makes him hit his targets easier. At
higher levels, his power is such that he may touch his enemy, sending mystic
vibrations throughout his target's body. This can severely damage and even
fatally wound his opponent. The monks of Derlith owe allegiance to no one,
wandering the land with the soul purpose of seeking enlightenment.
