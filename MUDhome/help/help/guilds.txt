Guilded Combat

Guilded players killing other guilded players works similar to clans. Players
may attack each other, regardless of whether they are lawful or not or whether
they are in the same guild or not. Guilded players will gain or lose experience
during combat, depending on who was killed and who did the killing.
Additionally, if the two players are of different guilds, all the money the
defeated player was carrying will be transfered to the bank account of the
victorious guild.

A guild's current PK rating is show in "guild list".
