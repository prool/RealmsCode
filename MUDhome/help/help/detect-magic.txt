This spell allows its target to detect magical items and monsters by connecting
the target's eyes to a magical plane. Magic items will glow a soft blue, denoted
by a nummerical plus or a (M). Spell-casting monsters will also be noted with a
(M). This spell can be used to identify many magic items as well as prepare for
an assault against a spell-casting creatute. Note that, while the majority of
magic items can be identified via this spell, it is not possible on all items.
