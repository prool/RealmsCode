This spell nullifies the effects of blindness on the target, healing their eyes
and restorting sight. Most often this spell is used to counteract the effects of
the blindness spell. Note, however, that if you are blind you cannot cast this
spell on yourself, so the spell will be of no use to you unless a companion is
able to cast it as well.

Syntax:
c cure-blindness <target>
