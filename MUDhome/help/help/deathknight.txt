A fearsome warrior augmented by powerful necromantic magics, a death knight
derives most of his demonic power directly from his evil god. The mission
of the death knight is the systematic and ordered pain and suffering of all
in his path. A death knight can be so evil as to drain the life from his
enemy when he attacks him. If he performs a blood sacrifice prior to battle,
he may infuse his dark soulless body with the drained life energies of his
victims. A death knight may pray to infuse  his body with evil, in order to
do more damage in attacks and also raising him strength for a time. This
evil is so destructive, in fact, that very powerful death knights are able
to touch their enemies and channel it into them, doing extreme damage.
Death knights also show their excellent combat abilities by their ability
to kick their victims once they reach enough experience to do so. The
nemesis of the death knight is the paladin, the warrior of light. The Death
Knight is so strong in his evil faith that he may renounce a Paladin to do
harm. Paladins are attacked on sight, as no quarter can be given to the
just and merciful.
