This spell protects its target from biting cold damage and from ice/frost traps
and breath weapons. A magical warmth is enbedded in the target that prevents
such low-temperature means of affecting the target. Note however that warmth
will not protect against magical cold as it is often more dangerous.

Syntax:
cast warmth <target>
