Hire allows you to take a monster as a pet that would help you during battle.
After a while, you must recompensate the monster for his efforts if you would
like to keep it. You may only hire monsters 3 levels lower than you; the higher
level the monster, the more it costs to hire.

Example:
: hire doctor $1000
The doctor begins to follow you.

To see if a monster is hireable, just try and hire them. Not all monsters are
hireable. To see how much it costs to hire a monster, you can try and hire them
for one gold coin.

Example:
: hire guard $1
The Highport guardsman demands at least 7500 gold coins.

(Note that Highport Guardsmen are NOT hireable. This is just an example.)
