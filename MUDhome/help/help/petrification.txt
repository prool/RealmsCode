A petrification attack is a special ability that will instantly turn your
character into stone. You will be unable to do anything to save yourself;
one of your comrades must cast a stone-to-flesh spell on you. Your hitpoints
will slowly decrease from the moment you are petrified. If you die while a
statue, your entire inventory will be destroyed.
