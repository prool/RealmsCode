Break is a command that allows your character to attempt to break an item,
thereby making it worthless and unusable. Note that various factors, such as
your strength, how broken/worn the item already is, and if it is magical or not
are factors that help determine whether you can break something.

Note: breaking wands can prove hazarous to your health.

Example:
: i
You have: a hoe.
