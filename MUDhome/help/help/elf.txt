Elves are the dwellers of Derlith's forests, a fairy folk who have lived for
centuries. The command elves have for magic is legendary, and as such they are
often very good mages. Most of an elf's life is spent in intellectual persuits
and studies of the world around him. He also has a fine appreciation of the
arts, and often is able to sing and dance very well. The elves of Derlith make
the best wine known, which is often consumed while sitting around fires telling
stories of times ancient past.  An elf is small and slender of stature, and due
to his size he is not as robust or strong as some other races. However, his
intellect eclipses that of nearly all other race on Derlith.
