Gag is a command which will allow you to filter out a certain player or players
by adding them to your gag list. It works much like the ignore command does
(HELP IGNORE). When another player is on your gag list, you do not see any
socials they do, anything they say, anything they broadcast, emote, and very few
things they do at all. In order to remove someone from your gag list, simply gag
them again. Typing gag by itself will display your gag list. Your gag list is
erased when you log off/on.

Syntax:
gag <player>
