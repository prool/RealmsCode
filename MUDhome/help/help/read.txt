The read command allows you to READ a scroll, thereby causing the spell
contained on the scroll to be cast. READ is different from STUDY in that the
spell is actually cast when you read the scroll, but you do not learn the spell.
It is different from CAST because no magic points are required to read a scroll,
and you do not have to know the spell to read it.

Example:
: read cha wino
You cast a zephyr spell on wino.
The spell did 11 damage.
You killed the wino.
You gained 6 experience for the death of the wino.
The chalky parchment disintegrates.
