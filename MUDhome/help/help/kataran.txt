Katarans are a race of savage cat people which live often live in Derlith's
tropical jungles and desert regions. They are quite uncivilized, to a point
where most of the civilized societies of Derlith fail to understand or accept
them. Katarans are medium of build and are quite strong for their size. Due to
their cat-like nature, they are also EXTREMELY agile and quick. Kats, as they
are sometimes called, have varying colors to their coats of fur, the females
usually having brighter colors and more varied markings then the males. They
all have tails which are almost prehensile. Because Katarans do not understand
normal civilization too well, they often are not quite as intelligent as
average due to ignorance. Katarans do not like, nor do they understand magic
and magical things, and Kataran shamans are often the most feared members of
their tribes. Due to their dexterity and constitution, Katarans are known to
be some of the best assassins and thieves in all of Derlith.
