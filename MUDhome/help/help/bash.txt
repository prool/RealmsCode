This command allows fighters and barbarians to bash an opponent, knocking it to
the floor for several seconds.  Bash does half the normal damage of a regular
attack, but it also causes the opponent to be delayed for several seconds while
he tries to get up off the floor.  This in effect gives the player the
initiative. Note that large players may bash without a weapon.

Syntax:
: bash win
You are too small to bash without a weapon.
: wield hoe
You wield a hoe.
: bash win
Your bash failed.
