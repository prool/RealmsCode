This spell recalls its target to the Origin, returning the target from any
distance to this safe location. However, magical formations can often cause this
spell to fail, and it is risky to use this spell while on the Ethereal Plane.
Word-of-recall may only be cast by clerics and paladins, but hazy potions are
often carried by many adventurers.

Syntax:
cast word-of-recall <target>
