Pay is a command which allows you to pay tolls to get through tolled exits.
Every toll location will have a toll collecting monster. They do not keep the
money on hand. It goes directly into a vault someplace. If there is no toll
collector, one cannot go through a tolled exit. Paying the toll automatically
moves you through the exit. You can find out how much you need to pay simply by
trying to go through the exit.

Example:
: pay $100 high gate
The Highport gatekeeper accepts your toll and ushers you through the gate.
