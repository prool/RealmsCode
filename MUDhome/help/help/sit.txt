Players may sit down at any time. While sitting, a player will gain one more hit
point and magic point than they normally would per tick. The downside of sitting
is that you are more vulnerable to attack. Therefore, if you are hit while
caught sitting down, you will take 1.5x the damage you normally would take (i.e.
15 and not 10). If ever attacked while sitting, you will stand immediately
and automatically after you are attacked. Not all attack forms provide this
extra damage to a sitting player.

You may not follow anyone or have anyone following you when you sit down.
You may type "stand" to stand up at any time.
