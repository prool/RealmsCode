Barbarians are wild savage humans who roam the Baladus Plains and other frontier
areas of Derlith. They are tribal in nature, and are led by a barbarian chief or
king usually. Humans in civilized areas often do not understand barbarians, and
vice versa, so there are usually cool relations between them. Barbarians do not
understand magic not related to battle enhancement or healing, so as a result
they usually don't trust mages. All barbarian warriors are berserkers, and all
barbarian clerics worship the god Ares, god of war, bloodlust, and battle.
Blood, battle, tribal honor, and steel are all a barbarian understands or cares
about. Barbarians are exceptionally large humans, occasionally over 7 feet in
height. They are extremely robust in stature. Their savage nature causes them
to be less intelligent due to ignorance, however.
