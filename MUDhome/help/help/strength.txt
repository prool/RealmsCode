The strength spell increases your strength, making you stronger and able to
perform tasks more efficiently. This spell does not last long, but while it is
in effect, you will do more damage in combat. A strength spell counteracts the
effects of a enfeeblement spell.

A strength spell will not work in conjunction with the berserk ability or a
deathknight's pray ability. Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this
spell.

Syntax:
cast strength <target>
