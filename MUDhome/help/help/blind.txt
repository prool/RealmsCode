This spell causes the target to become blind for a limited duration. While
blind, a player or monster is worse at combat and cannot cast. Players cannot
see the rooms they are in or their current inventories. Anyone can cast this
spell on a monster, but only chaotics can cast it on chaotic players. It
is possible to cast it on yourself.

Syntax:
c blind <target>
