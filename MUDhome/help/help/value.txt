The value command only works in pawn shops and it is used to ask the shopkeeper
how much money he will give you for a particular item. In a repair shop, use
the cost command to see how much the repair smith wants to charge you to fix a
given armor or weapon.

Example:
: val hoe
The shopkeep says, "The hoe's worth 2."
