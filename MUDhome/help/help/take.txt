Get and take allow you to pick up items that are on the floor of a room or
inside a container. The container may be in your inventory or sitting on the
floor. When you wish to get something from a container you must provide the name
of the item you want to take followed by the name of the container. Use the word
"all" to specify that you wish to take everything in the room or in a container.

Example:
: get all sack
You get an apple, a banana from a small sack.
