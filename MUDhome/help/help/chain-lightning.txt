MP cost: Dependant on the number of targets.

This spell affects all monsters in the area that the spell is cast in. Using
powerful magic, the caster is able to summon a potent lightning-bolt that
ricochets from reflectable objects in the room to strike all the designated
targets. Guided by magic, there is no way to dodge such a spell, but it can be
resisted by other magic. This spell is part of the electricity realm.
