MP cost: 50 / 30 / 10

The anchor spell allows you to form a dimensional-anchor in the room you are
currently in. Such an anchor allows you to focus the teleport spell, designating
a specific location to teleport to. This version of the spell costs 50mp to
cast. A caster may only have 3 dimensional-anchors in at a time. Destroying an
anchor costs 10mp instead of 50mp.

Alternatively, if the caster designates a player, the dimensional-anchor effect
will be placed on them, hindering magical movement. The spell will prevent
magical means of transportation from working properly: the spells blink,
ethereal-travel, summon, teleport, track, and word-of-recall will autmatically
have a 90% chance of failing in addition to any saving throws allowed. This
version of the spell costs 30mp to cast.

CAUTION: hazy potions will not work if you are dimensionally anchored.
Note: players under the effect of a dimensional anchor spell cannot track,
      but can still be tracked by other players.

Only mages and liches of atleast 16th level may cast this spell.

Syntax:
cast anchor <name|target> [create|destroy]
