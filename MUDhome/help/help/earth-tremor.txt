This is the most powerful spell in the earth realm. It causes a brief, violent
earthquake to commence beneath the feet of the target. In fact, the tremor can
be so violent that merely one is often enough to kill the intended target. Those
who live, though, suffer severe repercussions.

Syntax:
cast earth-tremor <target>
