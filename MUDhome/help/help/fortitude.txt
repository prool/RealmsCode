The fortitude spell increases your constitution, making you healthier and more
resistant to poison and disease. This spell does not last long, but while it is
in effect, you will have more hitpoints. A fortitude spell counteracts the
effects of a weakness spell. This spell cannot be cast on undead.

A fortitude spell will not work in conjunction with the berserk ability.
Only a mage, lich, druid, or cleric may cast this spell.

Syntax:
