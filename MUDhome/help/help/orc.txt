Orcs are fierce warriors which live mostly in forests and hills. They look like
a cross between a boar and a human, having pig-like nostrils, reddish eyes, and
tusks which protrude from their mouths. Orcs often travel in bands, raiding
humans, dwarves, and elves alike. Dwarves and orcs hate one another, as they've
been enemies since the beginning of time. Orcs are quite strong for their size,
yet they are also quite dull-minded.
