Duel is a command in which players can add one another to their "duel list".
Members on one another's  duel lists are freely able to fight one another at any
time, without fear of equipment loss or clan experience loss, with no pkill
loss, and regardless of alignment. You will always see a notification when
someone adds you to their duel list and vice versa. As well, you will also see
when someone removes you, and vice versa. In order to prevent deception,
however, any time you remove someone from your duel list, you will have an
automatic 10 second attack and cast delay. To be more detailed, this will mean
someone can't duel you, if both of you are chaotic, and then remove you from his
duel list and attack, thus eliminating the safety net of being in a duel.

Duel by itself will show you who all is on your duel list. Dueling someone a
second time will remove them from your duel list. Doing "duel clear" will clear
your entire duel list of players.

Your duel list is cleared automatically on log off/on. You, and your opponent,
must be level 4 or higher to be able to duel. Death as a result of a duel will
leave the loser in the same room knocked unconscious for 30 seconds, and down
to 1/10th max hit points and 0 magic points. This means if you're both chaotic
and/or pledged, you'd better trust whom your dueling, and it's not wise to duel
in dangerous areas of the mud.

IF YOU ARE CHAOTIC OR PLEDGED, YOU ARE DUELING AT A RISK. WHEN YOU WAKE UP IN
A NON-SAFE AREA, YOU WILL BE VULNERABLE. THEREFORE, PLEASE DUEL WITH CARE.
