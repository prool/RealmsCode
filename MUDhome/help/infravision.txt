MP cost: 5/10

This spell allows the person cast upon to see in the dark for a time. Anyone may
cast this spell upon themselves, and it will cost only 5MP. Mages, liches,
clerics, druids, and bards are all able to cast it upon others as well. In that
case it will cost 10MP to cast instead of 5MP.

Note that while some races can naturally see in the dark, there are magically
dark rooms for which you will need to use this spell.

Syntax:
cast infravision <player>
