The ability to defecate in Realms is actually linked with a free restore,
bringing your hit points and magic points back up to full. Note that you cannot
defecate in the middle of combat - you must flee, relieve yourself, and then
return.

Example:
: defec
You can't do that now! You are in combat!
Do you want to shit all over yourself?
:

: defec
You squat down and shit.
You feel SOOO much better now.
