This spell causes several blades of ice to form, flying in a whirlwind around
the target, savagely cutting and freezing them. The target is often impaled and
killed on the spot unless excessive stamina or other means of protection keep
it alive. Few will repeatedly survive castings of this spell.

Syntax:
cast iceblade <target>
