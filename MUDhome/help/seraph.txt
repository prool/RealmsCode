Seraphs are hybrid crosses between angels and humans of Derlith. Heavenly
creatures have been known to walk the earth in Derlith in recent years due to
the rise of evil in the land. Seraphs are usually quiet and keep to themselves.
They only learn of their divine half later after growing up. Seraphs often make
it their mission in life to point out any Cambion they may see to all around
them. Cambions often hide in society wreaking havoc. Due to their divine
connection, Seraphs are very very pious by nature. Thus, Seraphs make excellent
clerics.
