It is said that after certain gods created elves, other jealous gods attempted
to create a superior race and failed. The result was the goblin. The goblin is
a small and repugnant creature with big bulbous eyes and pointy teeth. He is
quite dull in intellect, yet he can eat almost anything and breeds like a
rabbit. Goblins are also very strong for their size, often fooling their
enemies. As a result, a goblin makes a very good fighter or barbarian. Many
tribes of goblins exist in Derlith, often to the chagrin of the areas around
them, as they often prey on weary travelers and merchants.
