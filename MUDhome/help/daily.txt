This command will allow you to see how many daily limited actions you have
remaining, such as tracks, teleports, enchants, heals, etc. If you do not have
the respective ability due to level or lack of the spell or whatever, it will
not show up. This command also will tell you if you are able to defecate or not,
as defecate is a restore.
