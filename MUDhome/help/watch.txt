The watch command allows you to watch over players in your group who take
damage. You have a "watch list". The watch command allows you to add people to
this list. You will see damage reports for those on your list. You must disable
group damage broadcasts ("set nogroup") in order to use this feature. Adding
someone to your watch list when they are already added will remove them, much
in the same manner as the IGNORE, GAG, and REFUSE commands. Typing watch by
itself will list everyone you are watching. Logging off/on will clear your watch
list.

Example:
: watch bob
Bob is now added to your watch list.
: watch
You are watching: Bob.
