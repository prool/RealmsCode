This spell helps its target avoid traps and climb well. Constantly staying a few
inches off the ground helps the target to avoid nasty pitfalls that could
otherwise prove deadly. Also, some un-climbable areas may suddenly become more
accessable as climbing is made easier by this spell.

Syntax:
cast levitate <target>
