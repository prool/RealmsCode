Berserkers are wild men - most are nomads who roam the Baladus Plains. Blood and
steel are all they know and understand. The lust for battle burns within them. A
berserker often goes berserk in battle (hence his namesake), heightening his
senses and increasing his strength. Despite his usual large size, a berserker is
often quick as a cat, and can dance circles around his enemies, confusing them.
With his brute strength, he is often able to daze his enemies, bashing them
senseless.
