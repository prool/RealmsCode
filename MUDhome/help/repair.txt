The repair command will allow you to repair an object that has been broken.
To find out how much the repair will cost, use the COST command first. Once an
item is repaired, it is as good as new. But watch out, sometimes a smith can
completely mess up the object you're trying to repair. You can look at the
smithy to see how skilled he is in repairing items. Also note that if your
alignment differs significantly from that of the smithy, you will have problems
fixing your items.
