Mud Client Compression Protocol v2

Mccp is a protocol which transparently compresses output to players. On a
supported client it should be automaticaly enabled. If you wish for some reason
to turn it off, or turn it on, simply type "mccp" at the prompt to toggle it. If
it is off and your client supports it, it will attempt to enable it. You can
check the status of it by typing score. Realms currently supports version2 of
protocol.

Zmud 6.06+ supports it, as well as several other clients. Mccp should help
reduce apparent lag to people, because we're sending less text at a time.
