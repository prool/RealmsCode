This spell improves your ability to hit monsters. It fills the target with holy
perception, whether good, neutral, or evil, and allows them to plan their blows
more carefully. Thus, with the help of a diety, it is more likely they will make
contact with their weapon when attacking.

Syntax:
cast bless <target>
