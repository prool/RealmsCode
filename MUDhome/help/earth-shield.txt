This spell protects its target from harsh environments by surrounding it with a
sphere of protective elements. The resulting magic is strong enough to protect
the target from the elements. Note that the target is only protected, not made
immune, and risky adventurers should be aware of such.

Syntax:
cast earth-shield <target>
