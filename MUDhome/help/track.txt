This spell allows druids and rangers to transport themselves across the world to
another person. The magic employs means similar to those used by the druids and
rangers to track their prey, although on a greater scale. At higher levels, they
will bring their entire group with them.

Track is a special ability that rangers, druids, werewolves and minotaurs have.
By searching for such signs as broken twigs, footprints, or other disturbances
to the natural setting (in the case of a werewolf or a minotaur, by using
scent), one is able to find tracks. The pass-without-trace spell will prevent
a player from leaving tracks in a room.
