This spell totally refills the HP of the person casted on fixing nearly any
wounds that can be inflicted. Heal can be cast by only paladins and non grey
aura clerics. Casters are limited to a certain number of uses per day, depending
on the level of the caster. It is very unwise and unhealthy for a lich to be the
recipient of this spell.

Syntax:
cast heal <target>
