This lowly spell causes a chill which drains body temperature abrubtly, harming
the target through system-shock. Generally most creatures' nerves are vulnerable
to such sudden changes in the temperate, though creatures innately immune to
cold will only suffer minor wounds.

Syntax:
cast chill <target>
