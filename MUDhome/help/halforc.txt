An illegitimate cross between an orc and a human, a half orc is shunned by all
society. Most often these freaks of nature wind up as criminals. Half orcs are
usually paid thugs, thieves or assassins. They can often be found high in the
ranks of many of Derlith's criminal organizations. They are not as agile as
some humans, but are often quite strong and sturdy. Most of them have bad
attitude as well, brought on by an inferiority complex due to no one accepting
them.
