Cambions are half-breeds between demons of Hell and humans. As such, they are
often of greater intellect then a mere human would be. They appear just as
humans, although they often have a distorted feature here and there, such as
pointed ears or strange colored skin, hair, or eyes. On occasion they even have
small horns. Cambions are very attuned to magic, and they make excellent mages.
Many Cambion Death Knights can be found as well. Cambion women are ALWAYS
beautiful and seductive, and they are often in highly influential positions.
Due to their unworldly connections and sometimes deformities, Cambions aren't
as dexterous as most. They aren't as robust in constitution as humans either.
