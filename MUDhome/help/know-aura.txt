This spell allows its target to see the alignment of a creature by looking at
it, a blue on the spectrum indicates good, red  indicates evil, and grey
indicates neutral. This spell is often used when the caster wishes to
determine how to deal with the target and its intentions. Note that paladins are
always under the influence of this spell.

Syntax:
cast know <target>
