The druid is the master of elements and the forces of mother nature. Such is the
affinity he has for the powers of the universe, that he can conjure elemental
creatures of earth, air, fire, and water to assist him. The forest is the
kingdom of the druid, where he can be the most together with nature. The order
of druids in Derlith is a complex hierarchy. The most experienced druids can
call very powerful elemental creatures to fight for them, yet only those druids
with the most devotion can hope to hold them to this world for long. Like a
ranger, a druid may also find tracks in a room in order to determine routes of
travel most often used. However, unlike a ranger, a druid is able to commune
with nature to learn the whereabouts of nearby creatures.
