The order command allows you to have your pet, if you have one, to perform a
social command or attack a monster/player. The pet command allows you to do the
same thing, but uses different syntax and doesn't require you to specify which
monster is your pet.

Example:
: pet wave
The wind bat waves happily.
: pet say hi
The wind bat says, "hi."
:

: order bat k wino
The wind bat attacks the wino.
: pet k wino
The wind bat stops attacking the wino.
:

: pet emote looks around for some food

: order bat emote looks around for some food
The wind bat looks around for some food.
