MP cost: 15/20

This spell summons a globe of magical darkness to follow the target around.
Anyone in the same room as the target will need the infravision spell to be
able to see. Anyone may cast this spell upon themselves, and it will cost only
15MP. Mages, liches, clerics, druids, and bards are all able to cast it upon
others as well. In that case it will cost 20MP to cast instead of 15MP.

Enoch does not condone the use of this spell. The darkness spell will last half
as long as normal if cast by a worshipper of Enoch. Arachnus is the opposite;
followers of Arachnus will find this spell lasts twice as long.

This spell is considered offensive, and it can be cast on lawful players
above third level.

Syntax:
cast darkness <player>
