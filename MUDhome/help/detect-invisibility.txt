This spell allows its target to see invisible items and creatures by connecting
their eyes to a magical plane. For the duration of the spell, the target will be
able to see invisible things. Note, however, they will not be able to detect
mists. In addition to this, an object or exit that is hidden and invisible will
still remain hidden by the means of this spell.

Syntax:
cast detect-invisibility <target>
