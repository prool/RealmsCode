A confusion attack is a special ability that some monsters have, often
delivered through a gaze attack.

A confused player will not always be able to walk in the direction they are
trying to go, may attack random creatures in the room (including yourself),
or flee from phantom danger. Your speech will be garbled and it will be very
difficult to understand what you are saying. An insight spell will dispel any
confusion you are under and will keep you from being confused for the duration
of the spell. A feeblemind spell makes you completely vulnerable to confusion.
