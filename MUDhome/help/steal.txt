Thieves may steal objects from monsters or other players. If they are
successful, the victim will not even know he or she was stolen from. However,
if unsuccessful, the victim is warned. Monsters usually get quite angry when
someone tries to steal from them.

Steal $ <person> will attempt to steal a random amount of gold from the target.
