Movement on Realms is very simple, for cardinal directions, such as north or
southeast, you can type the abbreviation (n or se) to travel in the indicated
direction. Up and down exits can also be accessed via abbreviations (u or d).
"Out" exits can also be abbreviate as simply out.

For all other exits, you will need to use the go / enter / leave command.
Simply type "go" followed by enough letters of the exit name to make it unique.
If there are multiple exits, you can specify which one by adding a number on
the end.

For closed exits, you will need to use the open and close commands.
