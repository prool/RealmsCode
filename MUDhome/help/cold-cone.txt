This powerful spell causes a cone of deadly frost to spread out from the
caster's hand in a cone, freezing almost anything its path. In addition to any
frozen limbs the target might experience, the shock of the temperature change
often causes more severe wounds. Targets who are generally resist to cold will
not experience such drastic effects.

Syntax:
cast cold-cone <target>
