Entangle is a spell only castable by rangers and druids, and then only when they
are not indoors. This spell will summon up a mass of tentacles from the ground
to grasp hold of the target. The victim may still fight back, but they are
prevented from leaving the room for a short time.

Syntax:
cast entangle <target>
