Rangers and rogues are allowed to use two weapons during combat, one in each
hand. They cannot use shields if they have a second weapon, and they cannot
use naturally two-handed weapons with one hand. The second weapon must be
lighter than the primary (wielded) weapon, and it will do less damage as a
second weapon than it would as a primary weapon.

Example:
: wield han
You wield a hand axe.
: sec kni
You wield a knife in your off hand.
