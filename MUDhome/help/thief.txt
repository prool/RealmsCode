Thieves are the rogues of Derlith, the common criminals and scam artists. Their
goal in life is to get ahead no matter what the cost, whether to themselves or
to others. A thief can steal very well, often taking things from his victim's
inventory without them even knowing it is even missing until hours later. He
also may peek at his victim's possessions so that he may know what he can take.
Like an assassin, a thief has the ability to strike from the shadows, stabbing
his enemy in the back to do massive damage in one strike. Although he is not as
adept at it as an assassin, the thief is still often able to kill his opponent
in this manner. All but the most exotic locks often are not an obstacle for a
thief, as he has the ability to pick them open to always get where he wants to
go. A thief can also hide in the shadows and often sneaks from place to place
without being seen, making him hard to detect or catch. A thief is so dexterous,
that he is able to dodge attacks the more experienced he becomes. Sometimes the
moves they make are amazing.

Thieves must pledge to reach levels 8, 9, 10, and 11.
