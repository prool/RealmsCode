Dwarves are jolly folk, short of stature and long of beard. They always have a
very bulky and stocky appearance. Dwarves are some of the toughest fighters
around, owing to years and years spent toiling in underground mines and hauling
rock. Dwarves love beer and ale, and will always take the opportunity to drink
them whenever the moment arrives. Due to their bulky build, dwarves are often
stronger then other races of similar size, and they are often usually healthier.
However, they aren't as quick as  other races their size and also aren't very
pious in general. Dwarves often make excellent armor and weapons, which they
often use to great effectiveness. Battle, mining, honor, and spirits are the
most important  things to a dwarf, besides the history and traditions of his
ancestors, which take precedence over all.
