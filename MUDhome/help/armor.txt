Armor is a spell castable only by mages and multiclass mages. When cast, it
forms a magical shield around the caster which makes them more difficult to
hit. It does not absorb damage, but instead tends to deflect blows and force
misses more often. As such, it makes default AC start at 6 and not 10. When
cast, it can protect from a number of points of damage  equal to the caster's
max hit points. Once those "virtual" points are used up, the armor spell
dissipates. It also  dissipates over time, longer if the caster is more
intelligent. If the spell is recast, the virtual points are set back to max.

For example:
Mageman the level 10 mage has 50hp and 50mp. In order to cast armor, it costs
him 10mp because he's level 10. The armor spell will protect up to 50 damage
before being dispelled, because Mageman has 50 max hit points. Note that the
spell doesn't ABSORB damage. It just provides lower AC until it dissipates
from taking damage, or over time.

Note that the spell protects from half as much damage if the caster is
multi-classed. So if Mageman was a Fighter/Mage, the spell would only protect
until it took 25 points, not 50.

This spell cannot be cast on anyone but the caster. Note also that the amount
of virtual damage the spell can still take is NOT displayed anywhere.
